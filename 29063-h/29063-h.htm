<h2><!-- page iii--><a name="pageiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iii</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>The author of the following Survey, has frequently had
opportunity of observing the very destitute and abject condition
of the Gypsey race, in the counties of Northampton, Bedford, and
Herts.&nbsp; The impressions received from viewing a state so
derogatory to human nature, induced him to make numerous
inquiries, in order to ascertain if necessity compelled their
continuance, under circumstances so deplorable as their condition
exhibited.</p>
<p>Not meeting with satisfactory intelligence on application to
various individuals, to whose observation Gypsies are frequently
presented, the author was excited to an examination of history,
for the developement of a case involved in so much obscurity; and
aggravated by circumstances so repugnant to the mild and genial
influences of the Christian Religion.</p>
<p>He must not however omit to state, that in Northamptonshire,
William Allen, who is in the profession of the law, at Higham
Ferrers, and Steward to Earl Fitzwilliam, very warmly interested
himself on the <!-- page iv--><a name="pageiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>subject.&nbsp; He said it afforded
him much pleasure to find, that some attention was excited to the
condition of the Gypsies, and that he should be glad to
co-operate, as far as was in his power, in any measures likely to
conduce to the reformation of this greatly neglected class of
British subjects.</p>
<p>He volunteered his services to find out the nearest Gypsey
rendezvous, and soon procured information of an encampment which
the writer visited.&nbsp; An account of the visit will appear in
the following sheets.&nbsp; The first assurance that the Gypsies
really had a language peculiar to themselves, which the author
received, was from this intelligent and obliging professor of the
law, who had heard children, as well as adults among them, speak
it with great fluency.</p>
<p>He also observed, that the situation of this people daily
became increasingly deplorable, in consequence of the
establishment of associations for the prosecution of felons; and
that the fear of apprehension as vagrants, and the progressive
inclosures near towns and villages, had a tendency to drive them
to a greater distance from the habitations of man.&nbsp; And he
was fully of opinion, as these houseless wanderers were expelled
from Township after Township, without any provision being made
for their refuge, that it was high time their case should obtain
the consideration of the public.</p>
<p><!-- page v--><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>Of the historic authorities whence the author has derived
information and interesting observation, he has to place in the
foremost rank, the Dissertation of the learned H. M. G.
Grellmann, translated a few years since, by the late M. Raper,
Esq.&nbsp; F.R.S. &amp; A.S.&nbsp; He has, however, to
acknowledge himself indebted to various other intelligent
authors, whose writings will be noticed in the course of the
work.</p>
<p>Another source of information, and which relates especially to
the <i>present state</i> of the Gypsies in Great Britain, has
been opened through inquiries instituted in most parts of the
nation, by the author, aided by several obliging and able
coadjutors.&nbsp; The results of these inquiries, it scarcely
need be added, will be presented to the reader in their proper
places.</p>
<p>The author has much regretted, that scarcely any of the
splendid histories of Counties in England, and even those in
which the Gypsies abound, have in the least noticed that part of
the population which so strongly claims our attention.&nbsp; By
bringing their situation into view, the historian might not
merely have served the cause of humanity; he would have advanced
the interest of the state, by promoting an object of so much
public utility, as the improvement of the whole Gypsey race
cannot fail to prove.</p>
<p>A comparative view of their customs and habits, and how far
they appear coincident in different countries, <!-- page vi--><a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>may afford a
criterion by which to judge if they have all had one
origin.&nbsp; By thus tracing them to that source, we may
possibly discover the occasion of their peculiarities; and if the
means hitherto employed to counteract them, have proved
unsuccessful, we may be prepared to consider of others, better
adapted to correct the errors of their education.</p>
<p>Conceiving that any scheme for ameliorating the condition of
the Gypsies, would not only be premature, but might prove highly
injudicious, before obtaining a knowledge of their history, the
author has endeavoured to collect, from the most authentic
European authorities to which he could have access, a general
view of this people, in the different parts of the world to which
they have resorted; and from these and the other sources of
information, he has subjoined accounts of their state in Great
Britain, and of the suggestions offered by other individuals for
their improvement; concluding the subject with a review of the
whole, and proposing a plan to be set on foot for accomplishing
this desirable object.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Various appellations of them&mdash;Their
arrival in Europe.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The different appellations by which the People whom we
denominate Gypsies, have been distinguished, appear generally to
have had reference to the countries, from which it was supposed
they had emigrated.</p>
<p>Grellmann states, that the French, having the first accounts
of them from Bohemia, gave them the name of
<i>Boh&eacute;miens</i>, Bohemians.&nbsp; That the Dutch
apprehending they came from Egypt, called them <i>Heydens</i>,
Heathens.&nbsp; In Denmark, Sweden, and in some parts of Germany,
Tartars were thought of.&nbsp; The Moors <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>and Arabians,
perceiving the propensity the Gypsies had to thieving, adopted
the name <i>Charami</i>, Robbers, for them.</p>
<p>In Hungary, they were formerly called Pharaohites, (<i>Pharaoh
Nepek</i>) Pharaoh&rsquo;s people; and the vulgar in Transylvania
continue that name for them.&nbsp; The idea of the English
appears to be similar, in denominating them Gypsies, Egyptians;
as is, that of the Portuguese and Spaniards, in calling them
<i>Gitanos</i>.&nbsp; But the name <i>Zigeuners</i>, obtained the
most extensive adoption, and apparently not without cause; for
the word <i>Zigeuner</i>, signifies to wander up and
down&mdash;for which reason, it is said, our German ancestors
denominated every strolling vagrant <i>Zichegan</i>.</p>
<p>The Gypsies are called not only in all Germany, Italy, and
Hungary <i>Tziganys</i>; but frequently in Transylvania,
Wallachia and Moldavia, <i>Cyganis</i>.&nbsp; But the Turks, and
other Eastern nations name them, <i>Tschingenes</i>.</p>
<p>The origin of this people has been a subject of inquiry for
more than three hundred years.&nbsp; Many persons have been
anxious to discover <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>&ldquo;who these guests were, that,
unknown and uninvited, came into Europe in the fifteenth century,
and have chosen ever since to continue in this quarter of the
globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continental writers state, that it is incredible how numerous
the hordes of this people are, and how widely dispersed over the
face of the earth.&nbsp; They wander about in Asia, the inferior
of Africa, and have established themselves in most of the
countries of Europe.&nbsp; Grellmann is of opinion, that America
is the only part of the world, in which they are not known.&nbsp;
Though no mention appears to be made of them by Authors who have
written on that quarter of the globe; yet no doubt remains, of
their having been in Europe nearly four hundred years.</p>
<p><i>Wilhelm Dilick</i> in his <span
class="smcap">Heszischen</span> <i>Chronik</i>, scit 229, beyn
Jahr 1414, informs us they arrived the same year in the Hessian
territories; but no mention of them appears in the public prints
till three years afterward.&nbsp; Mention is made of their being
in Germany as early as the year 1417; when they appeared <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>in the vicinity of the North sea.&nbsp; Fabricius, in
<i>Annalibb Misn</i>, says, they were driven from Meissen in
1416, but Calvisius corrects this date by changing it to
1418.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas Browne in his &ldquo;<i>Vulgar Errors</i>,&rdquo;
page 287, says, &ldquo;their first appearance was in Germany,
since the year 1400; nor were they observed before in other parts
of Europe, as is deducible from Munster, Genebrard, Krantzius and
Ortelius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Germany they spread so rapidly, that in 1418, their names
were recorded in the annual publications of various parts of the
country.&nbsp; They travelled in hordes, each having his leader,
sometimes called <i>Count</i>, others had the title of
<i>Dukes</i>, or <i>Lords of Lesser Egypt</i>.</p>
<p>In 1418 they were found in Switzerland, and in the country of
the Grisons; and in 1422 they made their appearance in
Italy.&nbsp; The Bologna Chronicle states, that the hordes which
arrived in that city, on the 18th of July, 1422, consisted of
about one hundred men, the name of whose leader, or Duke as they
termed him, <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>was Andreas.&nbsp; They travelled
from Bologna to Forli, intending to pay the Pope a visit at
Rome.</p>
<p>Their appearance in France bears the date of 1427, when the
French say, they straggled about Paris, having arrived on the
17th day of August in that year.</p>
<p>German Historians are agreed, that when the Gypsies first made
their appearance in Europe, they chose to be considered as
Pilgrims; and that their profession met with the more ready
belief, as it coincided with the infatuation of the times.&nbsp;
The learned Grellmann states, that several old writings mention
the credulity, with which people cherished the idea, that they
were real pilgrims and holy persons; that it not only procured
for them toleration, but safe-conducts in many places.</p>
<p>Munster declares, that they carried about with them passports
and seals from the Emperor Sigismund, and other Princes; by means
of which, they had free passage through different countries and
cities; and that he had <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>himself seen, an attested copy of
such a letter to the possession of some Gypsies at Eberbach.</p>
<p>Krantz, Stumpf, Guler, and Laurentius Palmirenus, all agree in
this statement..&nbsp; The Gypsies at Bologna also shewed an
instrument from Sigismund; but he appears to have granted this to
them, not as Emperor, and in Germany; but in Hungary, and as King
of Hungary.&nbsp; A pass of Uladislaus II. might also be quoted,
which the Gypsies obtained chiefly on account of their supposed
sanctity and pilgrimage.&nbsp; In Transylvania, it is asserted
they received letters of protection from the House of
Bathory.</p>
<p>Webner says, that the Gypsies in France quoted ancient
privileges, granted to them by the former Kings of that
country.</p>
<p>Crusius, Wurstisen, and Guler, mention papal permissions for
wandering unmolested through all Christian countries, as long as
the term of their pilgrimage lasted; which they asserted was
seven years.&nbsp; But at the expiration of that term, they
represented that their <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>return home was prevented by soldiers
stationed to intercept them.</p>
<p>The impression their pretensions had made on the people among
whom they came, did not entirely subside during half a century;
but afterward, &ldquo;the Gypsies being watched with a more
jealous eye, it appeared but too clearly, that, instead of holy
pilgrims, they were the mere refuse of humanity, who, often,
under pretexts of safe-conducts, committed all manner of
excesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their impositions being detected, it is probable some of them
were reduced to the necessity of having recourse to legitimate
means of subsistence, for within thirty years afterward, we have
accounts of Gypsies in Hungary being employed in the working of
iron.&nbsp; This occupation, appears from old writings, to have
been a favourite one with them.&nbsp; Bellonius also takes notice
of its being so; and there is a record of the Hungarian King
Uladislaus, in the year 1496, cited by the Abb&eacute;
<i>Pray</i> in his Annals; and by <i>Friedwalsky</i> in his
Mineralogy, wherein it is ordered, &ldquo;<i>That every </i><!--
page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

condition</i>, <i>do allow to Thomas Polgar</i>, <i>leader of
twenty-five tents of wandering Gypsies</i>, <i>free residence
every where</i>, <i>and on no account to molest him</i>, <i>or
his people</i>; <i>because they had prepared military stores for
the Bishop Sigismund at F&uuml;nfkirchen</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Accounts of the Gypsies in various
countries.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To propose means for improving the condition of Gypsies,
before we have informed ourselves of their real state, and what
has been done for them, would be as injudicious, as for a
Physician to prescribe for a patient, without being acquainted
with the nature or extent of his disease, and the means attempted
for his cure.&nbsp; To form a just opinion, on the case of the
Gypsies, it appears necessary to ascertain their general habits,
and their mode of life.</p>
<p>From Pasquier&rsquo;s <i>Recherches de la France</i>, B. IV.
C. 9, is selected the following account of the Gypsies in that
country: &ldquo;On August 17th, 1427, came to Paris, twelve
Penitents, <i>Penanciers</i>, as they called themselves, viz: a
Duke, an Earl, and ten men, all on horse-back, <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>and calling
themselves good christians.&nbsp; They were of Lower Egypt, and
gave out, that not long before, the Christians had subdued their
country, and obliged them to embrace christianity, on pain of
being put to death.&nbsp; Those who were baptized, were great
Lords in their own country; and had a King and Queen there.&nbsp;
Some time after their conversion, the Saracens over-ran their
country, and obliged them to renounce christianity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Emperor of Germany, the King of Poland, and
other Christian Princes, heard of this; they fell upon them, and
obliged the whole of them, both great and small, to quit their
country, and go to the Pope at Rome; who enjoined them seven
years&rsquo; penance, to wander over the world, without lying in
a bed.&nbsp; They had been wandering five years when they came to
Paris; first the principal people, and soon after the commonalty,
about 100, or 120, reduced from 1000, or 1200, when they came
from home; the rest being dead, with their King and Queen.&nbsp;
They were lodged by the police, out of the city, at Chapel St.
Denis</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Nearly all of them had their ears bored, and one
or two silver rings in each, which they said were esteemed
ornaments in their country.&nbsp; The men were black, their hair
curled; the women remarkably black, all their faces scarred,
<i>deployez</i>, their hair black, their only clothes a large old
shaggy garment, <i>flossoye</i>, tied over the shoulders with a
cloth or cord, sash, <i>lien</i>, and under it a poor petticoat,
<i>roquet</i>.&nbsp; In short, they were the poorest miserable
creatures that had ever been seen in France; and notwithstanding
their poverty, there were among them women, who by looking into
people&rsquo;s hands told their fortunes.&nbsp; And what was
worse, they picked people&rsquo;s pockets of their money; and got
it into their own, through telling these things by art, magic,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But though this was the common report, I spoke to them
several times, yet I never lost a farthing by them; or ever saw
them look into people&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; But the Bishop of
Paris, hearing of it, went to them with a Friar Preacher, named
<i>Le petit Jacobin</i>, who, by the Bishop&rsquo;s order,
preached a sermon excommunicating <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>all the men
and women who pretended to believe these things; and had believed
in them, and shown their hands; and it was agreed that they
should go away, and they departed for Pontoise, in September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was copied from an old book in the form of a
journal, drawn up by a doctor of divinity in Paris, which fell
into the hands of Pasquier; who remarks upon it, that however the
story of a penance savours of a trick, these people wandered up
and down France, under the eye, and with the knowledge of the
magistrates, for 100, or 120 years.&nbsp; At length, in 1661, an
edict was issued, commanding all officers of justice, to turn out
of the kingdom, in the space of two months, under pain of the
gallies, and corporal punishment, all men, women and children,
who assumed the name of <i>Boh&eacute;miens</i>, or
Egyptians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dufresne, in his Glossary V. &AElig;gyptiaci, confirms
Pasquier&rsquo;s character of them in these words:
&ldquo;&AElig;gyptiaci, Gallic&eacute; Egyptiens,
Boh&eacute;miens, vagi homines, harioli, et fatidici, qui hac et
illac errantes, ex manu inspectione futura <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>pr&oelig;sagire se fingunt; ut de marsupiis incautorum
nummos corrogent;&rdquo; which may be thus translated,
&ldquo;Egyptians called by the French Egyptiens,
Boh&eacute;miens, vagabonds, soothsayers and fortune-tellers,
who, wandering up and down, pretend to foretel future events from
the inspection of the hand, for the purpose of obtaining money
from persons not careful of their purses, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grellmann speaks of Gypsies &ldquo;being numerous in Lorraine
and Alsatia, before the French Revolution, but especially in the
forests of Lorraine.&nbsp; They increased in this district, in
consequence of their having been assiduously looked after in the
dominions of the late Duke Deux-Fonts, and driven from thence;
whither his successor would not suffer them to return.&nbsp; He
adds, that an order of the provincial council, held at Tarragona,
in 1591, subjected them to the magistrates, as people &ldquo;quos
vix constat esse Christianos, nisi ex eorum relatione, cum tamen
sint mendaces, fures, deceptores, et aliis sceleribus multi eorum
assueti;&rdquo; in English, &ldquo;who are scarcely allowed to be
Christians, <!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>except from their own account of
themselves, seeing they are liars, thieves, cheats, and many of
them accustomed to other kinds of wickedness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twiss, in his Travels p. 179, gives the following account of
them in Spain: &ldquo;They are very numerous about, and in,
Murcia, Cordova, Codis, and Ronda.&nbsp; The race of these
vagabonds is found in every part of Europe.&nbsp; The French call
them <i>Boh&eacute;miens</i>, the Italians <i>Zingari</i>, the
Germans <i>Ziegeuners</i>, the Dutch <i>Heydenen</i>, Pagans, the
Portuguese <i>Siganos</i>, and the Spaniards <i>Gitanos</i>, in
Latin, <i>Cingari</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their language, which is peculiar to themselves, is
every where so similar, that they are undoubtedly all derived
from the same source.&nbsp; They began to appear in Europe in the
15th century, and are probably a mixture of Egyptians and
Ethiopians.&nbsp; The men are all thieves, and the women
libertines.&nbsp; They follow no certain trade, and have no fixed
religion.&nbsp; They do not enter into the order of society,
wherein they are only tolerated.&nbsp; It is supposed there are
upwards of forty thousand of <!-- page 23--><a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>them in
Spain; great numbers of them are innkeepers in the villages, and
small towns; and they are every where fortune-tellers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Spain, they are not allowed to possess any lands,
nor even to serve as soldiers.&nbsp; They marry among themselves,
stroll in troops, about the country, and bury their dead under
water.&nbsp; Their ignorance prevents their employing themselves
in any thing, but in providing for the immediate wants of nature;
beyond which even their roguishness does not extend; and, only
endeavouring to save themselves the trouble of labour, they are
contented if they can procure food by showing feats of dexterity;
and only pilfer to supply themselves with the trifles they want;
so that they never render themselves liable to any severer
chastisement, than that of whipping, for having stolen chickens,
linen, &amp;c.&nbsp; Most of the men have a smattering of physic
and surgery, and are skilful in tricks performed by slight of
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The foregoing account is partly extracted from <i>Le
Voyageur Fran&ccedil;ois</i>, Vol. XVI.; but the assertion that
they are all so abandoned, <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>as that
author says, is too general.&nbsp; I have lodged many times in
their houses, and never missed the most trifling things, though I
have left my knives, forks, candlesticks, spoons, and linen at
their mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swinburne states, that &ldquo;they swarm more in the province
of Granada, than in any other part of the realm.&nbsp; This
singular sect have kept themselves separate from the rest of
mankind ever since their first appearance which has been recorded
in history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their origin remains a problem not to be satisfactorily
solved; and I doubt whether the Gitanos themselves, have any
secret tradition that might lead to a discovery of what they
really were in the beginning, or from what country they
came.&nbsp; The received opinion sets them down as Egyptians, and
makes them out to be the descendants of those vagabond votaries
of Isis, who appear to have exercised, in ancient Rome, pretty
much the same profession as that followed by the present Gypsies,
viz: fortune-telling, strolling up and down, and pilfering.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>&ldquo;Few of them employed themselves in works of
husbandry, or handicrafts; indeed the Spaniards would not work
with them.&nbsp; Except a small part of them who follow the
trades of blacksmiths, and vintners, most of them are makers of
iron rings, and other little trifles, rather to prevent their
being laid hold of as vagrants, than really as a means of
subsistence.&nbsp; Several of them travel about as carriers and
pedlars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though they conform to the Roman Catholic mode of
worship, they are looked upon in the light of unbelievers; but I
never could meet with any body that pretended to say what their
private faith and religion may be.&nbsp; All the Gypsies I have
conversed with, assured me of their sound Catholicism; and I have
seen the medal of <i>Nuestra Senora del Carmel</i> sewed on the
sleeves of several of their women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seldom venture on any crimes that may endanger
their lives; petty larceny is the utmost extent of their
roguishness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men are tall, well built, and swarthy, with a bad
scowling eye, and a kind of favorite <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>lock of hair
left to grow down before their ears, which rather increases the
gloominess of their features; their women are nimble and supple
jointed; when young they are generally handsome, with fine black
eyes.&nbsp; Their ears and necks are loaded with trinkets and
baubles, and most of them wear a large patch on each
temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Italian Gypsies, the same traveller in his journey
through Calabria, p. 304, gives the following account: &ldquo;The
landlord of the inn at Mirti, earnestly recommended to the
servants to leave nothing out of doors, as there was an
encampment of Zingari, or Gypsies, who would lay their hands upon
any part of the baggage, that was not watched with the strictest
attention.&nbsp; His caution led me to an inquiry into the state
of this strange tribe of vagrants, of whom I had seen great
numbers in Spain.&nbsp; The result of this account, combined with
those I had received from others, is as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsies of Calabria do not contract alliances with
any other class of inhabitants; but marry among themselves.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;It is not possible to say where they reside, as
they have no fixed habitations; and consequently possess neither
house nor land, but pitch their tents wherever they think proper
to make any stay.&nbsp; They support life by the profits of
handicrafts; but more by swapping asses and horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They generally work in iron, and make trivets, knitting
needles, bodkins, and such trifles.&nbsp; Their dress is
extremely shabby; they shave their chins, but indulge a great
length of hair, which they seldom disturb with either comb or
scissars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to their religion, it is a secret which they keep
locked up in their own breasts.&nbsp; They seem to have no great
veneration for the Virgin Mary, but are supposed to believe in
Christ.&nbsp; All the proof we have of their belief, depends upon
appearances, and an occasional conforming to the ceremonies of
the Roman Catholic religion, in marriages, burials, &amp;c.; but
if the priests start any difficulties, they manage the matter
without their interference, and perform the functions according
to their own <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>ceremonies, which in many points
resemble those of the heathens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At their weddings they carry torches, and have
paranymphs to give the bride away, with many other unusual
rites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in reality, almost absurd to talk of the religion
of a set of people, whose moral characters are so depraved, as to
make it evident they believe in nothing capable of being a check
to their passions.&nbsp; They are usually accounted pilferers,
cheats, faithless, and abandoned to dissoluteness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell fortunes, and play juggling tricks, just as
they do in all other countries where they are to be found.&nbsp;
In 1560, they were banished the kingdom as thieves, cheats, and
spies for the Turks.&nbsp; In 1569 and 1685, the order was
resumed, but not being enforced, had little effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Gypsey being brought to trial for a larceny,
declared, that his law allowed him to take as much from others,
every day, as sufficed for his maintenance.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;These people make use of two languages, one
Calabrian, with a foreign accent and pronunciation; the other a
peculiar one of their own, which in sound, seems to have great
affinity to the Oriental tongues; and is spoken when they have
secrets to impart to each other.&nbsp; They sleep like dogs in a
kennel, men, women, and children huddled together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The learned Grellmann states, that &ldquo;Gypsies were
universally to be found in Italy; insomuch, that even Sicily and
Sardinia were not free from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they were the most numerous in the dominions of the
church; probably because there was the worst police, with much
superstition.&nbsp; By the former they were left undisturbed; and
the latter enticed them to deceive the ignorant, as it afforded
them an opportunity of obtaining a plentiful contribution, by
their fortune-telling and enchanted amulets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a general law throughout Italy, that no
Gypsey should remain more than two nights, in any one
place.&nbsp; By this regulation, it is true, no place retained
its guest long; but <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>no sooner was one gone, than another
came in his room.&nbsp; It was a continual circle, and quite as
convenient to them, as a perfect toleration would have
been.&nbsp; Italy rather suffered, than benefited, by this law;
as, by keeping those people in constant motion, they would do
more mischief there, than in places where they were permitted to
remain stationary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears from the Dissertation of Grellmann, that he had
examined with great care and attention, the continental
authorities on the subject of Gypsies.&nbsp; He asserts, that
&ldquo;In Poland and Lithuania, as well as in Courland, there is
an amazing number of Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they are to be found in Denmark and Sweden, is
certain, but how numerous they are in those countries we cannot
pronounce, and therefore proceed to the south east of Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The countries in this part seem to be the general
rendezvous of the Gypsies; their number amounts in Hungary,
according to a probable statement, to upwards of 50,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cantemir says, the Gypsies are dispersed all over
Moldavia, where every Baron has several families of them subject
to him.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;In Wallachia and the Sclavonian mountains, they
are quite as numerous.&nbsp; Bessarabia, all Tartary, Bulgaria,
Greece, and Romania, swarm with them; even in Constantinople they
are innumerable.&nbsp; In Romania, a large tract of Mount
H&aelig;mus, which they inhabit, has acquired from them the name
<i>Tschenghe Valkan</i>, the Gypsey mountain.&nbsp; This district
extends from the city Aydos, quite to Phillipopolis, and contains
more Gypsies than any other province in the Turkish
empire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our countryman Edward Daniel Clark, in his travels in Russia,
Tartary, &amp;c. so lately as the year 1800, states, &ldquo;that
after the ceremony of the resurrection at Moscow, a party of
Gypsies were performing the national dance, called Barina; others
were telling fortunes, according to their universal practice, or
begging for presents of oranges or ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This extraordinary people, found in all parts of
Europe, were originally one of the Castes of India, driven out of
their territory, and distinguished among Indian tribes, by a name
which signifies thieves.&nbsp; They have a similar <!-- page
32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>appellation among the Fins, and with the same
signification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They preserve every where the same features, manners,
and customs, and what is more remarkable, almost always the same
mode of dress.&nbsp; The extraordinary resemblance of the female
Gypsies to the women of India, was remarked by the British
officers and men, in Egypt, when General Baird arrived with his
army to join Lord Hutchinson.&nbsp; The Sea-poys had many of
their women with them, who were exactly like our Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In their dress, they lavish all their finery upon their
heads.&nbsp; Their costume in Russia is very different to that of
the natives.&nbsp; The Russians hold them in great contempt;
never speaking of them without abuse; and feel themselves
contaminated by their touch, unless it be to have their fortunes
told.&nbsp; Formerly they were more scattered over Russia, and
paid no tribute; but now they are collected, and all belong to
one nobleman, to whom they pay a certain tribute, and work among
the number of his slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>P. 209, he writes: &ldquo;At Woronetz, the Gypsey tribe
are very prevalent, and a mixed race, resulting from their
intermarriage with the Russians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Clarke observes, Chap. 18, p. 440, 441 of his Travels,
between Kertchy and Caffa, in the Crimea: &ldquo;In the villages
we found parties of Tzigankies or Gypsies, encamped as we see
them in England, but having their tents stationed between their
waggons, in which they move about the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poultry, cats, dogs, and horses, were feeding all round
them, seeming like members of the same family.&nbsp; The Gypsies
are much encouraged by the Tartars, who allow them to encamp in
the midst of their villages, where they exercise the several
functions of smiths, musicians, and astrologers.&nbsp; Many of
them are wealthy, possessing fine horses, and plenty of other
cattle; but their way of life, whether rich or poor, is always
the same.&nbsp; As we entered their tents they arose, and cast a
sheep&rsquo;s hide over their bodies.&nbsp; The filth and stench
of these people were abominable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>In the second, part of his Travels, p. 644, he writes
respecting the Gypsies: &ldquo;We found this people in Nauplia,
under the name they bear in Moldavia, of Tchinganes.&nbsp; How
they came thither no one knew; but the march of their ancestors,
from the North of India to Europe, so lately as the beginning of
the 15th century, will account for their not being found further
towards the South; and this is now so well ascertained, that no
one would expect to meet a Gypsey, upon any of the southern
shores of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have found them in the Peloponnesus is rather
remarkable, considering that their whole tribe at first did not
exceed half a million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the travels, written by Bell, of Antermony, Vol. 2, p. 157,
he states: &ldquo;During my stay at Tobolski, I was informed that
a large troop of Gypsies had been lately at that place, to the
number of sixty or upwards.&nbsp; The Russians call these
vagabonds, <i>Tziggany</i>.&nbsp; Their sorry baggage was carried
upon horses and asses.&nbsp; The Vice-Governor sent for the <!--
page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>chief of this gang, and demanded whither they were
going.&nbsp; They answered to China.&nbsp; He stopped their
progress and sent them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop Pococke met with these people, still further to
the Eastward.&nbsp; He says, the Chingani, who are spread all
over the world, are in great abundance in the North of Syria, and
pass for Mahometans.&nbsp; They live under tents, and sometimes
in grots under ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make a coarse sort of tapestry, or carpet work,
for hangings of saddles and other uses; and when they are not far
from towns, deal much in cattle, and have a much better character
than their relations in Hungary, and the Gypsies in England; who
are thought by some to have been originally of the same
tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These and the Turcomen, with regard to offence, are
under the Pasha and Cadi; though they have a sheik to every
encampment, and several great ones over them: but with regard to
taxes, they are immediately under the Grand Seignior; whose
tribute is collected yearly, by an officer over each of these
people; one being called the Turcoman-Agasi, an officer of great
<!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>credit, and the other the Chingani-Agasi, who go round
the Turkish dominions to collect the taxes from these
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Travels, Vol. 2, Part 1, p. 207, 208.</p>
<p>Grellmann says: &ldquo;Independently of the number of Gypsies
in Egypt, and some parts of Asia, could we obtain an exact
estimate of them in the countries of Europe, the immense number
would probably greatly exceed what we have any idea of.&nbsp; At
a moderate calculation, without being extravagant, they might be
reckoned at between seven and eight hundred thousand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a serious matter of consideration, when we reflect
that the greatest part of these people, are idlers, cheats, and
thieves!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a field does this open for the contemplation of
Governments!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>SECTION III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The Habits, Occupations, and Polity of
Continental Gypsies.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The first of them that came to Europe, appeared ragged and
miserable, unless we allow their leaders to have been an
exception.&nbsp; In like manner their descendants have continued
for hundreds of years, and still remain.&nbsp; This is
particularly remarkable in the countries about the mouth of the
Danube, which abound with Gypsies; namely Transylvania, Hungary,
and Turkey, in Europe; where they dress even more negligently
than in other parts.</p>
<p>It is a fact that these people enjoy a good state of health
more uninterruptedly, and perfectly, than persons of the most
regular habits, and who pay the greatest attention to
themselves.&nbsp; Neither wet nor dry weather, heat nor cold, let
the extremes follow each other ever <!-- page 38--><a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>so quickly,
seem to have any effect upon them.&nbsp; Any prevailing sickness,
or epidemical disorder, sooner penetrates into ten habitations of
civilized people, than finds its way into a Gypsey&rsquo;s
tent.</p>
<p>Though they are fond of a great degree of heat, and to lie so
near the fire, as to be in danger of burning, yet they can bear
to travel in the severest cold, bareheaded, with no other
covering than some old rags carelessly thrown over them.</p>
<p>The causes of these bodily qualities, or at least some of
them, evidently arise from their education, and hardy manner of
life.</p>
<p>The pitiless mother takes her three months old child on her
back, and wanders about, in fair and foul weather, in heat or
cold; there it sits winter and summer, in a linen rug, with its
head over her shoulder.&nbsp; Gypsey women never use a cradle,
nor even possess such a piece of furniture.&nbsp; The child
sleeps in their arms, or on the ground.&nbsp; When a boy attains
three years of age, his lot becomes still harder.&nbsp; Whilst an
infant, and his age reckoned by <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>weeks and
months, he was wrapt in rags, but now deprived of these, he is
equally with his parents, exposed to the rigour of the elements,
for want of covering; he is now put to trial how far his legs
will carry him; and must be content to travel about with, at
most, no other defence for his feet than thin socks.</p>
<p>Thus he acquires a robust constitution by hardships and
misery; but though the children of Gypsies do not partake of what
the refinements of art and of tenderness would account
advantages, writers are unanimous in stating, they are
good-looking, well-shaped, lively, clever, and have fine
eyes.&nbsp; The Gypsies, in common with uncivilized people,
entertain unbounded love for their children.&nbsp; This is a
source of inexcusable neglect: Gypsey children never feel the
rod, they fly into the most violent passions, and at the same
time hear nothing from their parents but flattering and
coaxing.&nbsp; In return they act with ingratitude, as is
commonly the consequence of such education.</p>
<p>Gypsies would long ago have been divested of their swarthy
complexions, had they discontinued <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>their filthy
mode of living.&nbsp; The Laplanders, Samoieds, as well as the
Siberians, likewise, have brown, yellow-coloured skins, in
consequence of living from their childhood, in smoke and dirt, in
the same manner as the Gypsies.</p>
<p>Experience shows that their dark colour, which is continued
from generation to generation, is more the effect of education,
and manner of life, than of descent.&nbsp; Among those who serve
in the Imperial army, where they have learned to pay attention to
order and cleanliness, there are many to be found, whose
extraction is not at all discernible in their colour; though they
had, probably, remained to the age of twelve or fourteen years
under the care of their filthy parents.</p>
<p>A Gypsey considers a covering for the head as useless, and if
he does not obtain socks, which the female Gypsies in Moldavia
and Wallachia knit with wooden needles for the feet, he winds
rags about them, which are laid aside in summer.&nbsp; He is not
better furnished with linen, as the women neither spin, sew, <!--
page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>nor wash.&nbsp; But this inattention is not from
indifference about dress; on the contrary, they are particularly
fond of clothes, which have been worn by people of
distinction.&nbsp; The following, which appeared in the Imperial
Gazette, is very much to the purpose: &ldquo;Notwithstanding
these people are so wretched, that they have nothing but rags to
cover them, which do not at all fit, and are scarcely sufficient
to hide their nakedness; yet they betray their foolish taste, and
vain ostentation, whenever they have in opportunity.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The women are as fond of dress as the men, and equally expose
themselves to the ridicule of the considerate and reflecting part
of mankind.</p>
<p>They are remarkable not only in hanging their ragged clothes
about them instead of garments, according to the Eastern custom;
but their whole arrangement is singular.&nbsp; Several of their
leaders have horses, asses, or mules with them, on which they
load their tents and effects, with their whole family also.&nbsp;
They have likewise dogs in their train, with which Krantz asserts
they are used illegally, to destroy <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>game; but
probably the dogs are not kept so much for that purpose, as to
take fowls and geese.</p>
<p>One strange peculiarity in the ideas of Gypsies we have
hitherto forborn to mention, but, disgusting as the task of
recording it way be, it is so well authenticated, as to have
excited the notice of the Hungarian Legislature; and as it will
be found to have some reference to the origin of this singular
race of human beings, it must not be withheld from public
view.&nbsp; The greatest luxury to them is, when they can procure
a roast of cattle that have died of any distemper: to eat their
fill of such a meal, is to them the height of epicurism.&nbsp;
When any person censures their taste, or shows surprise at it,
they say: &ldquo;The flesh of a beast which God kills, must be
better than that of one killed by the hand of man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They therefore embrace every opportunity of obtaining such
dainties.</p>
<p>They are particularly fond of animals that have died by fire;
therefore, whenever a conflagration has happened, the next day,
the <!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Gypsies from every neighbouring quarter assemble, and
draw the suffocated, half-consumed beasts out of the ashes; men,
women, and children, in troops, joyfully carrying the flesh home
to their dwellings.</p>
<p>The Gypsies in Hungary, who have settled habitations, are very
partial to gold and silver plate, particularly silver cups, which
is a disposition they have in common with the wandering
tribes.&nbsp; They let slip no opportunity of acquiring something
of this kind; and will even starve themselves to procure
it.&nbsp; Though they seem little anxious to heap up riches for
their children, yet these frequently inherit a treasure of this
sort; and are obliged in their turn to preserve it as a sacred
inheritance.&nbsp; This inclination to deprive themselves of
necessaries that they may possess a superfluity, as well as many
others of their customs, is curious, yet appears to be ancient;
and it was probably inherent in them when they were first seen by
Europeans.</p>
<p>Historians assert, that of all the different people who have
migrated into foreign countries, <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>a single
instance is not to be found, which accords with that of the
Gypsies.&nbsp; The religious rites and observances of the Jews
were calculated to prevent their imbibing the customs and habits
of other nations.&nbsp; But it is universally admitted, that
Gypsies did not bring any particular religion with them from
their native country, by which they could be distinguished among
other people; being as inconstant and unsettled respecting
religion, as they are to place of residence.</p>
<p>Indeed it is asserted, that no Gypsey has any idea of
submission to any fixed profession of faith; that patents
suffering their children to grow up as themselves, without
education or instruction, they acquire little knowledge either of
morality or justice; that few of them wilt attend to any
discourse on religion, but they hear it with indifference, if not
with impatience and repugnance.&nbsp; Despising all remonstrance;
they endeavour to live without the least solicitude concerning a
future state of being.</p>
<p>The Turks are so fully convinced of the little religious
sincerity possessed by Gypsies, <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>that although
a Jew, by becoming a Mahometan, is freed from the payment of the
<i>Charadsch</i>, the Gypsies are not; at least in the
neighbourhood of Constantinople, they are compelled to pay the
poll-tax, even though their ancestors for centuries had been
Mahometans, or though they should actually have been a pilgrimage
to Mecca.&nbsp; The privilege of wearing a white turban, is the
only advantage their conversion gives them, over unbelieving Jews
and Gypsies.</p>
<p>Among warlike nations, many instances have occurred, in which
the people subdued, being more enlightened than their conquerors,
the latter have adopted the manners of the former.&nbsp; After
the conquest of Greece, the Romans assumed the manners of the
Greeks; and the Turks in like manner assumed those of the
Gauls.&nbsp; The Mancheans vanquished the Chinese, but Chinese
customs prevailed over those of the Mancheans.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Grellmann</i>.</p>
<p>Our countryman Dr. Clarke, page 4, of part the second of his
Travels in Greece, says: &ldquo;There is every reason to believe
that the <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Turks themselves, at the conquest of
Constantinople, adopted many of the customs, and embraced many of
the refinements of a people they had subdued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their former habits had been those of nomad tribes,
their dwellings were principally tents, and the camp, rather than
the city, distinguished their abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Grellmann observes, Gypsies who have not established
themselves by force in any country, nor obtained toleration from
any Government, remain unchanged.&nbsp; Though they behold fixed
dwellings on every side of them, with settled inhabitants, they
nevertheless, proceed in their own way, and continue, for the
most part, unsocial, houseless wanderers.</p>
<p>To their excessive indolence and aversion to industry, may be
attributed the poverty and want which are generally their
lots.&nbsp; They dislike every kind of employment which requires
application; and had rather suffer hunger and nakedness, than
provide against these privations, on the conditions of
labour.&nbsp; They therefore practise music and palmistry, which
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>allows them many idle hours; or addict themselves to
vicious habits and unlawful courses.&nbsp; Though no one of them
marries a person who is not of Gypsey extraction, there is not
any people among whom marriage is contracted with less
consideration, or accomplished with less solemnity.</p>
<p>Some Gypsies, who are stationary, have regular habitations,
according to their situation in life.&nbsp; To this class belong
those who keep public-houses in Spain; and others in Transylvania
and Hungary, who follow some regular business; which latter have
their own miserable huts near Hermanstadt, Cronstadt, Beatritz,
Grosswaradein, Debrezin, Eperies, Karchan, and other
places.&nbsp; But by far the greater number of these people, lead
a very different kind of life; ignorant of the comforts attending
a fixed place of residence, they rove from one district to
another in hordes; having no habitation, but tents, holes in the
rocks, or caves: the former shade them in summer, the latter
screen them in winter.</p>
<p><!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Many of these people, particularly in Germany and Spain,
do not even carry tents with them, but shelter themselves from
the heat of the sun, in forests shaded by the rocks, or behind
hedges.&nbsp; They are very partial to willows, under which they
erect their sleeping places at the close of the evening.&nbsp;
Some live in their tents, in their language called
<i>Tschater</i>, during both summer and winter; which latter
indeed the Gypsies generally prefer.</p>
<p>In Hungary, those who have discontinued their rambling way of
life, and built houses for themselves, seldom let a spring pass
without taking advantage of the first settled weather, to set up
a tent for their summer residence.&nbsp; Under this, each enjoys
himself with his family, nor thinks of his house till winter
returns, and the frost and snow drive him back to it.</p>
<p>The wandering Gypsey in Hungary and Transylvania, endeavours
to procure a horse; in Turkey, an ass serves to carry his wife
and a couple of children, with his tent.&nbsp; When he arrives at
a place he likes, near a village, or a city, he unpacks, pitches
his tent, ties his <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>animal to a stake to graze, and
remains some weeks there: or if he do not find his station
convenient, he breaks up in a day or two, loads his beast, and
looks out for a more agreeable situation.&nbsp; His furniture
seldom consists of more than an earthen pot, an iron pan, a
spoon, a jug and a knife; with sometimes the addition of a
dish.&nbsp; These serve for the whole family.</p>
<p>Working in iron is the most usual occupation of the
Gypsies.&nbsp; In Hungary, this profession is so common, that
there is a proverb: &ldquo;So many Gypsies so many
smiths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same may be said of those in Transylvania, Wallachia,
Moldavia, and all Turkey in Europe; at least such workers in fire
are very numerous in all those countries.&nbsp; But the Gypsies
of our time, are not willing to work heavy works; they seldom go
beyond a pair of light horse shoes.&nbsp; In general, they
confine themselves to small articles, such as rings and nails;
they mend old pots and kettles; make knives, seals, and needles;
and sometimes they work in tin and brass.&nbsp; Their materials,
tools, and apparatus, are of a very inferior <!-- page 50--><a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>kind.&nbsp;
The anvil is a stone; the other implements are a pair of hand
bellows, a hammer, a pair of pincers, a vice, and a file.&nbsp;
These ape the tools which a Nomadic Gypsey takes with him in his
perambulations.</p>
<p>Whenever he is disposed to work, he is at no loss for fuel: on
his arrival at a station where he proposes to remain a few days,
he takes his beast, loads him with wood, builds a small kiln, and
prepares his own coal.&nbsp; In favourable weather, his work is
carried on in the open air; when it is stormy, he retires under
his tent.&nbsp; He does not stand, but sits down on the ground
cross-legged to his work; which position is rendered necessary,
not only by custom, but by the quality of his tools.&nbsp; The
wife sits by to work the bellows, in which operation she is
assisted by the elder children.&nbsp; The Gypsies are generally
praised for their dexterity and quickness, notwithstanding the
bad tools they have to work with.</p>
<p>Another branch of commerce much followed by Gypsies, is
horse-dealing, to which they have been attached from the earliest
period of their <!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>history.&nbsp; In those parts of
Hungary, where the climate is so mild, that horses may lie out
all the year, the Gypsies avail themselves of this circumstance
to breed, as well as to deal in horses; by which they sometimes
not only procure a competency, but grew rich.&nbsp; Instances
have been known on the Continent, of gypsies keeping from fifty
to seventy horses each; and those the best bred horses of the
country; some of which they let out for hire, others they
exchange or sell.&nbsp; But this description of Gypsey
horse-dealers is not numerous; the greater number of them deal in
inferior kinds.</p>
<p>In addition to the two professions before-mentioned, commonly
followed by the men, some of them employ themselves as carpenters
and turners; the former making watering troughs and chests; the
latter turn, trenchers and dishes; make sieves, spoons, and other
trifling articles, which they hawk about.&nbsp; Many of them, as
well as the smiths, find constant employment in the houses of the
better sort of people; for whom they work the year round.&nbsp;
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>They are not paid in money, but beside other advantages
find a certain subsistence.</p>
<p>Those who are not thus circumstanced, do not wait at home for
customers, but with their implements in a sack thrown over their
shoulders, seek business in the cities and villages.&nbsp; When
any one calls, they throw down the bundle, and prepare the
apparatus for work, before the door of their employer.</p>
<p>The Gypsies have a fixed dislike to agriculture; and had
rather suffer hunger, or any privation, than follow the
plough.&nbsp; Since the year 1768, the Empress Theresa has
commanded that the Hungarian, and Transylvanian Gypsies should be
instructed in husbandry; but these orders have been very little
regarded.&nbsp; At this time there are so few of them farmers in
those parts, that they are undeserving of notice.&nbsp; In Spain
and other European countries, it would be difficult to find one
who had ever made a furrow in his life.</p>
<p>Respecting fortune-telling, with which the female Gypsies
impose on people&rsquo;s credulity in every district and corner
of Europe, the origin, <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of the imposition is not to be
attributed to them: the cheat was known and practised in Europe
before their arrival; being deeply rooted in the ignorance of the
middle age.&nbsp; The science of divination here was said to be
already brought to a greater degree of perfection than among
them.&nbsp; Rules were invented to tell lies from the inspection
of the hand, in which the poor Gypsies were accounted mere
bunglers.&nbsp; They in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
were esteemed supernumeraries; there being men of great learning,
who not only read lectures in Colleges on the art of chiromancy;
but wrote many books, vilifying these people, and endeavouring to
spoil their market.&nbsp; But these wise men are no more; their
knowledge is deposited in the dead archives of literature; and
probably had there been no Gypsies, with them would have died the
belief in chiromancy, as is the case with respect to astrology,
necromancy, oneirocritica, and the other offspring of imbecile
fancy.</p>
<p>We must not omit to mention the occupation of gold-washing, by
which thousands of Gypsies, <!-- page 54--><a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>of both
sexes, in the Banat, Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia,
procure a livelihood in summer; who, in winter, make trays and
troughs, which they sell in an honest way.</p>
<p>It is not permitted for every one, without exception, to be a
gold-washer; such only can follow the employment as have
permission from the office of Mons, where a College was
established by the Empress Theresa, in 1748.&nbsp; In the seventh
article of instructions granted, the Gypsies were allowed the
privilege of washing for gold, for which each person pays a
tribute to Government.</p>
<p>The gold-washers in Transylvania and the Banat, pay four
guilders annually in gold dust.&nbsp; The tribute collected in
Wallachia and Moldavia does not go into the public treasury, but
belongs to the Princesses for pin-money.</p>
<p>The consort of the Wallachian Hospodar, Stephen Rakowitza, in
the year 1764, received from her Rudars, being two hundred and
forty in number, twelve hundred and fifty-four drachms.&nbsp; The
gold-washers in the Banat and Transylvania, dispose of their
shares at the <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Royal Redemption-Office, in
Zalatuya.&nbsp; The earnings of these people vary with time, and
at different places; during heavy rains and floods they are
usually most successful.&nbsp; The Transylvanian rivers yield the
most gold.&nbsp; It is said, all the rivers and brooks which the
rain forms, produce gold; of these the river Aranyasch is the
richest; insomuch, that Historians have compared it to the Tagus
and Pactolus.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Grellmann</i>.</p>
<p>In Travels through the Banat of Temeswar, Transylvania, and
Hungary, in the year 1770, described in a series of letters to
Professor Ferber, on the mines and mountains of these different
countries, by Baron Inigo Born, Counsellor of the Royal Mines, in
Bohemia, page 76, is the following account:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observations on the Gold-washings, in the Banat, by
Counsellor Koezian.&nbsp; Translated by R. E. Ruspe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the several natural advantages of the <i>Temeswar
Banat</i>, some of its rivers are known to yield gold dust; I
could not neglect the object when I travelled in these parts.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;The gold-washing in the Banat, is properly the
business of the Gypsies, <i>Zigeuner</i>, and left, as it were,
to this poor people, as an exclusive trade.&nbsp; This laid me
under the necessity of applying to them for instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river Nera, in Almash, carries gold dust; and
seemed to me the fittest for my purpose; accordingly I caused
some Gypsies, reputed to be skilful, to make a washing, near a
village called Boshowitz; and I saw with pleasure, that with much
dexterity, and in a few minutes time, they cleared in the trough,
the value of some groshes of gold: they showed me likewise among
their gold dust, some pieces of remarkable bigness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been stated, that when Gypsies first arrived in Europe,
they had leaders and chiefs to conduct their various tribes in
their migrations.</p>
<p>Grellmann says, this was necessary, not only to facilitate
their progress through different countries and quarters of the
globe; but to unite their force, if necessary, and thereby enable
them to make a more formidable resistance <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>when opposed;
and likewise, to carry any plan they might have formed, more
regularly into effect.</p>
<p>We accordingly find in old books, mention made of Knights,
Counts, Dukes, and Kings, among this people.&nbsp; Crucius cites
a Duke, <i>Michael</i>; Muratorio, a Duke, <i>Andreas</i>: and
Arentinus records a King, <i>Zindelo</i>: not to speak of
inscriptions on monuments erected in different places to the
memories of Duke, <i>Panuel</i>; Count, <i>Johannis</i>; and a
Knight, <i>Petrus</i>, in the fifteenth century.</p>
<p>But no comment is necessary to show how improperly these
appellations were applied.&nbsp; Though the Gypsey chiefs might
be gratified with such titles; and their descendants probably
esteemed them persons of rank, it was merely a ridiculous
imitation of what they had seen, and perhaps admired, among
civilized people.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the custom of having
leaders and chiefs over them, prevails to this time, at least in
Hungary and Transylvania; probably it may also still exist in
Turkey, and <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>other countries, where these people
live together in great numbers.</p>
<p>Their chiefs, or waywodes, were formerly of two degrees in
Hungary.&nbsp; Each petty tribe had its own leader, beside which,
there were four superior waywodes, of their own caste, on both
sides the Danube and Teisse; whose residences were at Raab,
Lewentz, Szathmar, and Kaschan; and to these the smaller waywodes
were accountable.&nbsp; But now, only one superior waywode is
appointed in all Transylvania, who has authority over the
gold-washers in those parts.&nbsp; The Gypsies, however, still
continue the custom among themselves, of choosing certain
persons, whom they make heads over them, and call by the exalted
Sclavonian title of waywode.</p>
<p>It would appear extraordinary, that any well-regulated state
should allow these people a distinct establishment in the heart
of the country; did not the Hungarian writers assign as a reason,
that in the commotions and troubles occasioned by the Turkish
wars, in former centuries, they were, by means of their waywode,
more <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>easily summoned when occasion required, and rendered
useful to the community.</p>
<p>In Transylvania, the magistrates do interfere with regard to
the person whom this or that horde hath elected chief, and impose
an obligation on him; but it is only that he should be careful to
prevent his subjects from absconding, when the time arrives for
them to discharge their annual tribute at the Land Regent&rsquo;s
chamber.&nbsp; He has no right to interfere in disputes or
quarrels which the Gypsies have among themselves, or with other
people, further than to give notice of them to the regular courts
of the district, where they happen to be.</p>

61</span>SECTION IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Political Regulations on the Continent,
respecting Gypsies.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>To the ignorance and superstition of the middle age, must be
attributed the powerful ascendency which the Gypsies obtained
over the minds of men.&nbsp; In addition to the chiromantic
deception, practised by the women, they followed also the
profession of exorcism; and were greatly in request during the
prevalence of a belief in witchcraft.</p>
<p>They were employed to cure bewitched cattle, and to loosen the
spells of enchantment; for which they had nostrums of various
kinds, consisting of roots and amulets, made of unfermented
dough, marked with strong figures, and dried in the sun.</p>
<p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>For a long time little attention was paid to them, but
at last the evil became enormous, and complaints against them
were so loud, that Governments were constrained to take official
notice of them.&nbsp; Exemplary punishments were judged
necessary; and, at length, the most cruel and barbarous kinds
were resorted to.&nbsp; What a blot upon the history of those
times, are the dreadful tortures of quartering alive, and
breaking upon the wheel!&nbsp; These means being insufficient to
prevent the perpetration of crimes; it was thought expedient to
banish the Gypsies.</p>
<p>German waiters say, that King Ferdinand of Spain, who esteemed
it a good work to expatriate useful and profitable
subjects&mdash;Jews, and even Moorish families&mdash;could much
less be guilty of an impropriety in laying hands on the
mischievous progeny of Gypsies.&nbsp; The edict for their
extermination, was published in the year 1492.&nbsp; But instead
of passing the boundaries, they only slunk into hiding-places,
and shortly after appeared in as great numbers as before.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>The Emperor Charles V. persecuted them afresh; as did
Philip II. also.&nbsp; Since that time they have nestled in
again, and have been also threatened with another storm, but it
has blown over without taking effect.</p>
<p>In France, Francis I. passed an edict for their expulsion; and
at the Assembly of the States of Orleans, in 1561, all Governors
of cities received orders to drive them away with fire and
sword.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in process of time, they had collected
again, and increased to such a degree, that, in 1612, a new order
came out for their extermination.</p>
<p>In the year 1572, they were compelled to retire from the
territories of Milan and Parma; and at a period somewhat earlier,
they were chased beyond the Venetian jurisdiction.&nbsp; They
were not allowed the privilege of remaining unmolested in
Denmark, as the code of Danish law specifies: &ldquo;The Tartars,
<i>Gypsies</i>, who wander about every where, doing great damage
to the people, by their lies, thefts, and witchcraft, shall be
taken into custody by every magistrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Sweden was not more favourable, having attacked them at
three different times: A very sharp order for their expulsion
came out in 1662.&nbsp; The Diet of 1723 published a second, and
that of 1727, repeated the foregoing with additional
severity.</p>
<p>They were excluded from the Netherlands under pain of death,
partly by Charles the Vth, and afterwards by the United States,
in 1582.&nbsp; But the greatest number of sentences of exile,
have been pronounced against them in Germany.&nbsp; The beginning
was made under Maximilian I, at the Augsburgh Diet, in 1500,
where the following was drawn up, respecting those people who
call themselves Gypsies, roving up and down the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By public edict, to all ranks of the empire, according
to the obligations under which they are bound to Us, and the Holy
Empire; it is strictly ordered, that in future they do not permit
the said Gypsies, since there is authentic evidence of their
being spies, scouts, and conveyers of intelligence, betraying the
christians to the Turks, to pass or remain within their <!-- page
65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>territories; nor to trade; neither to grant them
protection, nor convoy.&nbsp; And that the said Gypsies do
withdraw themselves, before Easter next ensuing, from the German
dominions; entirely quit them, nor suffer themselves to be found
therein: as in case they should transgress after that time, and
receive injury from any person, they shall have no redress, nor
shall such person be thought to have committed any
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same business occupied the attention of the Diet, in 1530,
1544, 1548, and 1551; and was also again enforced in the improved
police regulation of Frankfort, in 1577.</p>
<p>Several Princes were however so little attentive to these
orders of the empire, that instead of endeavouring to drive out
the Gypsies, they on the other hand, furnished them with
passports and safe-conducts; but by far the greater number
exerted themselves to the utmost, to clear their states of
them.</p>
<p>Perhaps there is not any civilized state, Hungary and
Transylvania excepted, where this remedy has not been tried; but
in the first <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>place it had very little effect, and
that little was only temporary.&nbsp; Even if every civilized
nation had driven out the Gypsies at the same time, Europe could
not have been entirely cleared of them, so long as they preserved
an asylum in Turkey.&nbsp; Now as experience evinces there is no
country in which a constant, equal attention, is paid to the
execution of the laws, they would, in more, or less time, have
again insinuated themselves into the neighbouring countries; from
these into others; and have recommenced where they left off.</p>
<p>But a general extermination never did take place.&nbsp; The
law for banishing them passed in one state before it was thought
of in the next, or when a like order had long become obsolete,
and sunk into oblivion.&nbsp; These guests were therefore merely
compelled to shift their quarters to an adjoining state, where
they remained till the Government, there, began to clear them
away, upon which the fugitives either retired back whence they
came, or went on progressively to a third place, thus making a
continual revolution.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Secondly, this remedy was premature: endeavouring to
exterminate, was the same as if a surgeon should proceed directly
to the amputation of a diseased limb, because it created
inconvenience to the rest of the body.&nbsp; Whereas the first
inquiry ought to be, whether the disorder is of such a nature as
not to be removed, but by entire separation.&nbsp; This is a
desperate course, and should only be adopted, when no other can
be efficacious.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted that, not until the reign of the Empress
Theresa, does there appear to have been any plan laid down for
the gaining over these poor ignorant people to virtue, and to the
state.&nbsp; Historians represent that the wise dispositions she
enjoined respecting the Gypsies in Hungary, were intrusted to
people inadequate to the task.</p>
<p>What was done, in her time, for the improvement of their
condition, may be seen by the following article extracted from
the <i>Anzeigen aus den Kayserl</i>, <i>K&ouml;nigl
Erbl&auml;ndern</i>, or Intelligence from the Hereditary Imperial
Royal Dominions.</p>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;Since the year 1768, several decrees regarding
these people have been published in the country, <i>Hungary</i>,
and the strictest orders despatched to the several districts, in
consequence.&nbsp; They were prohibited from dwelling in huts, or
tents; from wandering up and down the country; from dealing in
horses; from eating animals which died naturally, and carrion;
and from electing their own Wayda or Judge.&nbsp; It was intended
to extirpate the very name and language of these folks out of the
country.&nbsp; They were no longer to be called Gypsies, but New
Boors, <i>Uj Magyar</i>; not to converse any longer with each
other in their own language, but in that of any of the countries
in which they had chosen to reside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some months were to be allowed, after which they were
to quit their Gypsey manner of life, and settle like the other
inhabitants, in cities and villages; to build decent houses and
follow some reputable business.&nbsp; They were to procure
Boors&rsquo; clothing; to commit themselves to the protection of
some territorial superior, and live regularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>Nevertheless, though these regulations were calculated
for the good of these people, and the state, the greater part
were not in the smallest degree benefited by them.&nbsp; In the
year 1773, these orders were not only repeated, but made more
rigid; and as even this measure would not answer the end, it was
then thought necessary to proceed to extremity with them.</p>
<p>Wherefore it was ordered, that no Gypsey should have
permission to marry, who could not prove himself in condition to
support a wife and children; that from such Gypsies who had
families, the children should be taken away by force; removed
from their parents, relations, and intercourse with the Gypsey
race.&nbsp; A beginning was made in some places; and where they
would not comply voluntarily, they were compelled to submit to
the decree.</p>
<p>At Fahlendorf, in Sch&uuml;tt, and in the district of
Presburgh, all the children of the New Boors, <i>Gypsies</i>,
above five years old, were carried away in waggons, during the
night of the 21st of December, 1773, by overseers appointed for
that purpose; to order that, at a <!-- page 70--><a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>distance from
their parents, or relations, they might be more usefully
educated, and become accustomed to work.&nbsp; Those Boors who
were willing to receive and bring up these children, were paid
eighteen guilders yearly from Government.</p>
<p>On the 24th of April, 1774, between five and six o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, the children of the Gypsies which had been
growing up from December of the foregoing year, were again
removed from Fahlendorf, in Sch&uuml;tt, and Hideghid, for the
purpose of being put under the same course of discipline as the
others.&nbsp; Among the children taken away on this occasion, was
a girl fourteen years old, who was forced to be carried off in
her bridal state.&nbsp; She tore her hair for grief and rage, and
was quite beside herself with agitation: but she recovered a
composed state of mind; and, in 1776, in Fasching, obtained
permission to accomplish her marriage.</p>
<p>So far our intelligence is quoted from the Gazettes, by which
we may see how prudently every thing was concerted.</p>
<p><!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>But it must be observed, although the publisher of this
information endeavours to conceal it, how little these salutary
regulations were put in force; there were scarcely two places in
the kingdom where even an endeavour was made to give them proper
effect.&nbsp; This supineness must have been unknown to the
Emperor Joseph, or he would certainly again have enforced these
regulations, to all chiefs and governors, at the same time that
he gave orders for their being observed in Transylvania.</p>
<p>The tenor of the decree just mentioned, which was published in
the year 1782, was consonant with the intention of Theresa, with
regard to the Hungarian Gypsies; namely, that those also in
Transylvania should become better men, and more useful
inhabitants.&nbsp; For the accomplishment of this end, it
prohibits their wandering about, and living under tents; requires
that they become settled, and put themselves under some
territorial chief.&nbsp; In order to strike immediately at the
root of the evil, necessary and minute directions are given for
the improvement of their religious ideas and <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>opinions;
and, by correcting their vicious habits, for rendering them good
citizens.</p>
<p>First, with respect to religion, they must</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Not only be taught the principles of religion
themselves, but early send their children to school.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Prevent as much as possible, their children running
about naked in the roads and streets, thereby giving offence and
disgust to other people.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In their dwellings, not permit their children to
sleep promiscuously by each other, without distinction of
sex.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Diligently attend at church, particularly on Sundays
and holidays, to give proof of their Christian disposition.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Put themselves under the guidance of spiritual
teachers, and conduct themselves conformably to the rules laid
down by them.</p>
<p>Secondly, with regard to their temporal conduct, and better
mode of living, they are bound</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To conform to the custom of the country, in diet,
dress, and language: consequently to abstain from feeding on
cattle which have died <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of distempers; not to go about in
such unseemly dresses; and to discontinue the use of their own
particular language.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Not to appear any more in large cloaks; which are
chiefly useful to hide things that have been stolen.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; No Gypsey, except he be a gold-washer, shall keep a
horse.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Also the gold-washers must refrain from all kinds of
bartering at the annual fairs.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The magistrates of every place must be very attentive
that no Gypsey waste his time in idleness; but at those seasons,
when they have no employment, either for themselves or any
landholder, to recommend them to some other person, with whom
they shall be compelled to work for hire.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; They are to be kept particularly to agriculture;
therefore</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; It is to be observed, where possible, that every
territorial Lord, who takes any Gypsies under his jurisdiction,
do allot them a certain piece of ground to cultivate.</p>
<p><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>8.&nbsp; Whoever is remiss in his husbandry, shall be
liable to corporal punishment.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; They shall be permitted to amuse themselves with
music, or other things, only when there is no field work for them
to do.</p>
<p>Such were the regulations adopted by the Emperor Joseph II.
for the purpose of civilizing, and rendering good and profitable

<p class="gutsumm">The Gypsies in Great Britain.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The traits of character and the habits of the Gypsies on the
Continent of Europe, exhibited in this work, are sufficient for
an examination, in what degree these people correspond with those
under the same denomination in England.</p>
<p>The earliest account which the writer of this section has been
able to collect from British History, was printed in the year
1612; when a quarto work, by S. R. was published, to detect and
expose the art of juggling and legerdemain; in which is the
following description of the Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of people, about a hundred years ago, beganne
to gather an head, as the first heere, about the southerne
parts.&nbsp; And this as I am informed, and can gather, was <!--
page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>their beginning: Certain Egyptians banished their
country, (belike not for their good conditions,) arrived heere in
England, who for quaint tricks and devices, not known heere, at
that time, among us, were esteemed, and had in great admiration;
insomuch, that many of our English <i>Loyterers</i> joined with
them, and in time learned their craftie cosening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The speach which they used, was the right Egyptian
language, with whom our Englishmen conversing, at least learned
their language.&nbsp; These people continuing about the country,
and practising their cosening art, purchased themselves great
credit among the country people, and got much by palmistry, and
telling of fortunes; insomuch, they pitifully cosened poor
country girls, both of money, silver spoons, and the best of
their apparelle, or any goods they could make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this author, it is collected, they had a leader of the
name of <i>Giles Hather</i>, who was termed their King; and a
woman of the name of <i>Calot</i>, was called Queen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These riding <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>through the country on horseback, and
in strange attire, had a prettie traine after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After mentioning some of the laws passed against them, this
writer adds: &ldquo;But what numbers were executed on these
statutes you would wonder; yet, notwithstanding, all would not
prevaile, but they wandered as before uppe and downe, and meeting
once in a yeare at a place appointed; sometimes at the
Peake&rsquo;s Hole in Derbyshire, and other whiles by Ketbroak at
Blackheath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About the same time, Spellman&rsquo;s Portrait of the Gypsey
Fraternity seems to have been taken, ad vivum, and is as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egyptiani, Erronum, Impostorumque genus nequissimum, in
Continente ortum; sed ad Britannos nostras et Europam reliquam
pervolans, nigredine deformes, excocti sole, immundi veste, et
usu rerum omnium f&aelig;di, &amp;c.;&rdquo; which may be thus
translated, &ldquo;Egyptians, the worst kind of wanderers and
impostors, springing up on the Continent, but yet rapidly
spreading themselves through Britain, and <!-- page 78--><a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>other parts
of Europe, disfigured by their swarthiness; sun-burnt; filthy in
their clothing, and indecent in all their customs,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the first of these statements, the arrival of
Gypsies in England might be about the year 1512; or ten years at
least before the Statute of the 22d of Henry VIII; in the 10th
chapter of which, they are described to be, &ldquo;<i>An
outlandish people</i>, <i>calling themselves Egyptians</i>,
<i>using no crafte</i>, <i>nor feat of merchandise</i>; <i>who
have come into this realm</i>, <i>and gone from shine to
shire</i>, <i>and place to place in great company</i>; <i>and
used great</i>, <i>subtle</i>, <i>and crafty means</i>, <i>to
deceive the people</i>, <i>bearing them in hand</i>, <i>that they
by palmistry could tell men&rsquo;s and yeomen&rsquo;s
fortunes</i>; <i>and so</i>, <i>many times by crafte and subtlety
have deceived the people of their money</i>; <i>and also have
committed many heinous felonies and robberies</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wherefore they are directed to avoid the realm, and not to return
under pain of imprisonment, and forfeiture of their good and
chattels; and upon their trials for any felonies which they may
have committed, they <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>shall not be entitled to a Jury <i>de
medietate lingu&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>The Act passed the 27th of the came reign goes farther, as
will appear by the following abstract of it: &ldquo;<i>Whereas
certain outlandish people</i>, <i>who do not profess any crafte
or trade whereby to maintain themselves</i>, <i>but go about in
great numbers from place to place</i>, <i>using insidious</i>,
<i>underhand means to impose on his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects</i>,
<i>making them believe that they understand the art of
foretelling to men and women their good and evil fortune</i>,
<i>by looking in their hands</i>, <i>whereby they frequently
defraud people of their money</i>; <i>likewise are guilty of
thefts and highway robberies</i>: <i>it is hereby ordered that
the said vagrants</i>, <i>commonly called Egyptians</i>, <i>in
case they remain one month in the kingdom</i>, <i>shall be
proceeded against as thieves and rascals</i>; <i>and on the
importation of any such Egyptian</i>, <i>he</i>, (<i>the
importer</i>) <i>shall forfeit</i> &pound;40 <i>for every
trespass</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the above recited Acts of Parliament, it appears, that it
was from their own representation <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>of being
Egyptians, they were so denominated in England; and that they did
not on their arrival in this country, feign themselves, as in
Germany, to be pilgrims; or as in France, to be penitents;
neither of which impositions would have been well adapted to the
temper of the government of Henry VIII; or to his subversion of
papal power, and abolition of monastic influence.&nbsp; The
character they assumed, was the best adapted to establish their
reputation, for the arts and deception they intended to practise
in England.&nbsp; The fame of Egypt in astrology, magic, and
soothsaying, was universal; and they could not have devised a
more artful expedient, than the profession of this knowledge, to
procure for them a welcome reception by the great mass of the
people.</p>
<p>From the abstract of the Act of 27th, Henry VIII, we may
infer, that the Gypsies were so much in request, as to induce
some of our countrymen to import them from the Continent, or at
least to encourage their migration to this Island.&nbsp; The
importation of these people <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>must have
been prevalent from some cause, to require parliamentary
interference, and even a fine to prevent it, of such an amount as
&pound;40; which according to the relative value of money, would,
at the present time, be equal to a large sum.</p>
<p>During the same reign, we find that a number of Gypsies were
reshipped at the public expense, and sent to France.</p>
<p>In the Book of Receipts and Payments, of the 35th of Henry
VIII. are the following entries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nett Payments 1st Sept. 36th of Henry VIII,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Item to Tho. Warner, Sergeant of the Admyraltie, 10th
Sept. for victuals prepared for a shippe appointed to convey
certaine Egupeians, 58s.&mdash;Item to the same Tho. Warner to
th&rsquo; use of John Bowles for freight of said shippe, &pound;6
5s.&nbsp; Item to Robt. Ap. Rice, Esq. Shriff of Huntingdon for
the charge of the Egupeians at a special gaile delivery, and the
bringing of them to be conveied over the sees; over and besides
the sum of &pound;4. 5s. 0d. growing of seventeen <!-- page
82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>horses, sold at five shillings <a
name="citation82"></a><a href="#footnote82"
class="citation">[82]</a> the piece, as apperythe by a particular
book, &pound;17. 17s. 7d.&nbsp; Item to Will. Wever appointed to
have the charge of the conduct of the said Egupeians to Callis,
&pound;5.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were subsequent acts relating to Gypsies in the reign of
Ph. &amp; M.; and 5th of Eliz.; by which, &ldquo;<i>If any person
being</i> 14 <i>years old</i>, <i>whether natural born subject or
stranger</i>, <i>who had been seen in the fellowship of such
persons</i>, <i>or had disguised himself like them</i>, <i>should
remain with them one month at once</i>, <i>or at several
times</i>, <i>it should be felony without benefit of
clergy</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But notwithstanding these measures to extirpate Gypsies,
Wraxall, in his History of France, Vol. II. page 32, in referring
to the Act of Eliz. in 1563, states, that in her reign, the
Gypsies throughout England were supposed to exceed ten
thousand.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>And it appears by the following Order of Sessions,
copied from the Harleian M.S.S. British Museum, No. 364, that
about the year 1586, there were great complaints of the increase
of vagabonds and loitering persons, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orders, Rules, and Directions, concluded, appointed,
and agreed uppon, by us the Justices of the Peace, within the
countie of Suffolk, assembled at our General Sessions of Peace,
holden at Bury the 22d daie of Aprill, in the 31st yeare of the
Raigne of our Souraigne Lady, the Queen&rsquo;s Majestie, for the
punishinge and suppressinge of Roags, Vacabonds; idle,
loyteringe, and lewde persons; which doe, or shall hereafter
wander and goe aboute, within the hundreths of Thingo cum Bury,
Blackborne, Thedwardstree, Cosford, Babings, Risbridge, Lackford,

contrary to the law, in that case made and provided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, at the Parliement beganne and holden at
Westminster, the 8th daie of Maye, in the 14th yeare of the
raigne of the Queen&rsquo;s Majestie, that nowe is, one Acte was
made, <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>intytuled, &ldquo;An Acte for
punishment of Vacabonds, and for releife of the Pooere, and
Impotent.&rdquo;&nbsp; And whereas, at a Session of the
Parliament, holden by prorogacon, at Westminster, the eight daie
of February, in the 28th yeare of her Majestie&rsquo;s raigne,
one other Acte was made and intytuled, &ldquo;An Acte for
settinge of the Poore to work, and for the avoydinge of
idleness.&rdquo;&nbsp; By vertue of which, severall Acts,
certeyne provisions and remedies been ordeyned, and established,
as well for the suppressinge, and punishinge of all roags,
vacabonds, sturdy roags, idle and loyteringe persons; as also for
the releife, and setting on worke of the aged and impotente
persons within this realm; and authoritie gyven to Justices of
Peace, in their several charges and commission, to see that the
said Acts and Statuts be putte in due execution, to the glorie of
Allmightie God, and the benefite of the common welth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whereas also yt appeareth by dayly experience, that
the number of idle, vagraunte, loyteringe, sturdy roags,
masterles men, lewde and yll disposed persons are exceedingly
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>encreased, and multiplied, committinge many grevious and
outeragious disorders and offences, tendinge to the great . . .
of Allmightie God, the contempte of her Majestie&rsquo;s laws,
and to the great charge, troble, and disquiet of the common
welth.&mdash;We the Justices of Peace, above speciefied,
assembled and mett together at our general sessions above named,
for remedie of theis and such lyke enormities which hereafter
shall happen to arise or growe within the hundreths and lymits
aforesaid, doe by theis presents, order, decree and ordeyne, That
there shall be builded or provided one convenient house, which
shall be called the House of Correction; and that the same be
established within the towne of Bury, within the hundreth of
Thingoe aforesaid.&nbsp; And that all persons offendinge or
lyvinge contrary to the tenor of the said twoe Acts, within the
hundreths and lymitts aforesaid, shal be, by the warrante of any
Justice of Peace, dwellinge in the same hundreths or lymitts,
committed thether and there be releived, punished, sett to worke,
and <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

provisions, and limitations, hereafter in theis presents declared
and specified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fyrst, That yt maie appeare what persons arre to be
apprehended, committed and brought to the House of Correction, it
is ordered and appointed, That all and every person and persons
which shal be found and taken within the hundreths and lymitts
aforesaid, above the age of 14 yeares, and shall take upon them
to be procters or procurators goinge aboute withowt sufficiente

plaie&mdash;all such as faynt themselves to have knowledge in
phisiognomye, palmestrie or other abused sciences&mdash;all
tellers of destinies, deaths or fortunes, and such lyke
fantasticall imaginations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the tenor of the above Ordinance, it might be inferred
that, at the time of issuing it, Gypsies, and their adherents,
abounded in the County of Suffolk; and it may be concluded, that
they continued to attach themselves to that part of the nation,
as Judge Hale remarks, <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>that &ldquo;at one Suffolk Assize, no
less than thirteen Gypsies were executed upon these Statutes, a
few years before the restoration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the honour of our national humanity, however, Judge
Blackstone observes, there are no instances more modern than
this, of carrying these laws into practice; and the last,
sanguinary act is itself now repealed.&nbsp; The severe statute
of 5th Eliz. c. 20 is repealed by 23d Geo. III. c. 51&mdash;and
Gypsies are now only punishable under the Vagrant Act, which
declares, &ldquo;that all persons pretending to be Gypsies, or
wandering in the habit, and form of Egyptians, shall be deemed
rogues, and vagabonds.&rdquo;&mdash;17th Geo. II. c. 5.</p>
<p>In Scotland, these people seemed for a time to enjoy some
share of indulgence; for a writ in favour of John Faw, Lord and
Earl of Upper Egypt, was issued by Mary, Queen of Scots, 1553;
and in 1554, he obtained a pardon for the murder of Numan
Small.</p>
<p>In 1579, however all the legislative provisions respecting
vagrants, beggars, &amp;c. in Scotland, were reduced into one
law, by the following <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>very comprehensive statute:
&ldquo;Forameikle as there is sindrie loyabil Acts of Parliament,
maid be our soveraine Lord&rsquo;s maist nobil progenitours, for
the stanching of maisterful and idle beggars, away putting of
Sornares, and provision for the pure: bearing that nane sall be
thoiled to beg, nouther to burgh, nor to land, betwixt 14 and 70
zeires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sik as make themselves fules, and ar bairdes, or
uther sik like runners about, being apprehended, sall be put into
the Kinge&rsquo;s waird, or irones, sa lang as they have ony
gudes of their awin to live on.&nbsp; And fra they have not
quhairupon to live of their awin, that their eares be nayled to
the trone, or to an uther tree, and their eares cutted off, and
banished the countrie; and gif thereafter they be found againe,
that they be hanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that it may be knowen, qwhat maner of persones ar
meaned to be idle and strang begares, and vagabounds, and warthy
of the punischement before specified, it is declared: &ldquo;That
all idle persones ganging about in ony countrie of this realm,
using subtil, craftie, and <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>unlawful
playes, as juglarie, fast-and-lous, and sik uthers; the idle
peopil calling themselves <i>Egyptians</i>, or any uther, that
feinzies themselves to have a knawledge or charming prophecie, or
other abused sciences, qwairby they perswade peopil, that they
can tell their weirds, <a name="citation89"></a><a
href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a> deathes, and
fortunes, and sik uther phantastical imaginations,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this law, a writ of Privy Seal, dated 1594,
supports John Faw, Lord and Earl of Little Egypt, in the
execution of justice upon his company of folk, conform to the
laws of Egypt, in punishing certain persons there named, who had
rebelled against him, left him, robbed him, and refused to return
home with him.</p>
<p>James&rsquo; subjects are commanded to aid in apprehending
them, and in assisting Faw and his adherents to return home.</p>
<p>From all these circumstances, it appears that this John Faw,
or two persons of the same name and distinction, succeeding each
other, <!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>staid a long time in Scotland; and
from him this kind of strolling people might receive the name of
Faw Gang, which they still retain, as appears by Burn&rsquo;s
Justice.</p>
<p>But the Scottish laws, after this time, were not less severe
than those of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; By an Act passed in 1609;
&ldquo;Sorners, common thieves, commonly called Egyptians, were
directed to pass forth of the kingdom, under pain of death, as
common, notorious, and condemned thieves.&rdquo;&nbsp; Scottish
Acts, I. 850.</p>

91</span>SECTION VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">The present State of the Gypsies in
Scotland.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The energy and perseverance by which North Britons are
distinguished, will be evinced throughout the pages of this
section.&nbsp; A friend of the author, having been requested to
make application at the Advocates&rsquo; and the University
Libraries, in the city of Edinburgh, for extracts from some
foreign publications, was also desired to transmit with them what
information could be obtained respecting the Gypsies in
Scotland.</p>
<p>With a promptitude and zeal which characterises genuine
philanthropy, a circular, containing four queries, was dispatched
to the Sheriff of every county in that nation; soliciting through
the medium of an official organ, all the intelligence which could
be obtained on the subject.&nbsp; In consequence, returns have
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>been made from nearly the whole of the shires, either by
the Sheriff, or his substitute; generally addressed to George
Miller, jun. Edinburgh; who has been a most effective coadjutor
on this occasion.</p>
<p>From thirteen counties, the reports are, &ldquo;No Gypsies
resident in them;&rdquo; some others give account of their only
passing through at times.</p>
<p>William Frazer Tytler, Sheriff of Invernessshire, writes as
follows: &ldquo;The undertaking in which you are engaged, for the
civilization of so lost a portion of mankind, merits every
support.&nbsp; Its effects may be more generally and extensively
useful in England, where those unfortunate people are extremely
numerous.&nbsp; In Scotland, their number is comparatively small,
and particularly in the county of Inverness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alexander Moor, Sheriff Depute, of Aberdeenshire, states:
&ldquo;There are not any Gypsies who have a permanent residence
in that Sheriffalty.&nbsp; Occasionally vagrants, both single and
in bands, appear in this part of the country; resorting to fairs,
where they commit <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>depredations on the unwary.&nbsp;
Some of them are supposed to be connected with Gypsies in the
southern part of the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Blair, Sheriff Substitute for the County of Bute, writes:
&ldquo;I have to inform that the people generally known by the
description of Gypsies, are not in use to come hither, unless
abject, itinerant tinkers and braziers, generally from Ireland,
may be accounted such.&nbsp; A few of them often visit us, and
take up their abode for a time in different parts of the country,
where people can be prevailed upon to give them the accommodation
of an out-house or hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are understood to be illiterate, neither they, nor their
children, who are often numerous, being able to read.</p>
<p>The distinguished northern Poet, Walter Scott, who is Sheriff
of Selkirkshire, has in a very obliging manner communicated the
following statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A set of people possessing the same erratic habits, and
practising the trade of tinkers, are well known in the Borders;
and have often <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>fallen under the cognisance of the
law.&nbsp; They are often called Gypsies, and pass through the
county annually in small bands, with their carts and asses.&nbsp;
The men are tinkers, poachers, and thieves upon a small
scale.&nbsp; They also sell crockery, deal in old rags, in eggs,
in salt, in tobacco and such trifles; and manufacture horn into
spoons, I believe most of those who come through Selkirkshire,
reside, during winter, in the villages of Sterncliff and Spittal,
in Northumberland, and in that of Kirk Yetholm,
Roxburghshire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smith, the respectable Baillie <a
name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a> of Kelso, can give the most complete
information concerning those who reside at Kirk Yetholm.&nbsp;
Formerly, I believe, they were much more desperate in their
conduct than at present.&nbsp; But some of the most atrocious
families have been extirpated, I allude particularly to the
<i>Winters</i>, a Northumberland clan, who I fancy are all buried
by this time.</p>
<p><!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Mr. Reddell, Justice of Peace for Roxburghshire,
with my assistance and concurrence, cleared this country of the
last of them, about eight or nine years ago.&nbsp; They were
thorough desperadoes, of the worst class of vagabonds.&nbsp;
Those who now travel through this country, give offence chiefly
by poaching, and small thefts.&nbsp; They are divided into clans,
the principal names being Faa, Baillie, Young, Ruthven, and
Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of them are perfectly ignorant of religion, nor do
their children receive any education.&nbsp; They marry and
cohabit amongst each other, and are held in a sort of horror by
the common people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not conceive them to be the proper Oriental
Egyptian race, at least they are much intermingled with our own
national out-laws and vagabonds.&nbsp; They are said to keep up a
communication with each other through Scotland, and to have some
internal government and regulation as to the districts which each
family travels.</p>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;I cannot help again referring to Mr. Smith of
Kelso, a gentleman who can give the most accurate information
respecting the habits of those itinerants, as their
winter-quarters of Yetholm, are upon an estate of which he has
long had the management.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very satisfactory to have received from an authority so
respectably as that of William Smith, the Baillie of Kelso, above
referred to, answers to the four queries of the circular;
accompanied by his own interesting and appropriate illustrations,
from which extracts are made as follow, dated November, 1815.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A considerable time having elapsed, since I had an
opportunity, or occasion to attend to the situation of the colony
of Gypsies in our neighbourhood, I was obliged to delay my answer
to your inquiries, until I could obtain more information
respecting their present numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great bar to the benevolent intentions of improving
their situation will be, the impossibility to convince them that
there either is, <!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>or can be, a mode of life preferable,
or even equal to their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strong spirit of independence, or what they would
distinguish by the name of liberty, runs through the whole
tribe.&nbsp; It is no doubt a very licentious liberty, but
entirely to their taste.&nbsp; Some kind of honour, peculiar to
themselves, seems to prevail in their community.&nbsp; They
reckon it a disgrace to steal near their homes, or even at a
distance, if detected.&nbsp; I must always except that petty
theft of feeding their shelties and asses on the farmer&rsquo;s
grass and corn, which they will do, whether at home or
abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When avowedly trusted, even in money transactions, they
never deceived me, nor forfeited their promise.&nbsp; I am sorry
to say, however, that when checked in their licentious
appropriations, &amp;c. they are very much addicted both to
threaten and to execute revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having so far premised with respect to their general
conduct and character, I shall proceed to answer, as far as I am
able, the four queries subjoined to the circular which you <!--
page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>sent me, and then subjoin, in notes, some instances of
their conduct in particular cases, which may perhaps elucidate
their general disposition and character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Query 1st.&nbsp; <i>What number of Gypsies in the
County</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A.&nbsp; I know of none except the colony of Yetholm,
and one family who lately removed from that place to Kelso.&nbsp;
Yetholm consists of two towns, or large villages, called
<i>Town</i> Yetholm, and <i>Kirk</i> Yetholm.&nbsp; The first is
in the estate of Mr. Wauchope, of Niddry; the latter in that of
the Marquis of Tweedale.&nbsp; The number of the Gypsey colony at
present in Kirk Yetholm, amounts to at least 109 men, women, and
children; and perhaps two or three may have escaped notice.&nbsp;
They marry early in life, in general have many children, and
their number seems to be increasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Query 2d.&nbsp; <i>In what do the men and women mostly
employ themselves</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;B.&nbsp; I have know the colony between forty and fifty
years.&nbsp; At my first remembrance of them, they were called
the <i>Tinklers</i>, <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>(Tinkers) of Yetholm, from the males
being chiefly then employed in mending pots, and other culinary
utensils, especially in their peregrinations through the hilly
and less populous parts of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they were called <i>Horners</i>, from their
occupation in making and selling horn spoons, called
Cutties.&nbsp; Now their common appellation is that of
<i>Muggers</i>, or, what pleases them better,
<i>Potters</i>.&nbsp; They purchase, at a cheap rate, the cast or
faulty articles, at the different manufactories of earthenware,
which they carry for sale all over the country; consisting of
groups of six, ten, and sometimes twelve or fourteen persons,
male and female, young and old, provided with a horse and cart to
transport the pottery; besides shelties and asses to carry the
youngest of the children, and such baggage as they find
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the country, they sleep in barns, and byres, or
other out-houses: and when they cannot find that accommodation,
they take the canvas covering from the pottery cart, and <!--
page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>squat below it like a covey of partridges in the
snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few of the colony also employ themselves occasionally
in making beesoms, foot-bosses, &amp;c. from heath, broom, and
bent, and sell them at Kelso, and the neighbouring towns.&nbsp;
After all, their employment can be considered little better than
an apology for idleness and vagrancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in general great adepts in hunting, shooting,
and fishing; in which last they use the net and spear, as well as
the rod; and often supply themselves with a hearty meal by their
dexterity.&nbsp; They have no notion of being limited in their
field sports, either to time, place, or mode of destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see that the women are any otherwise employed,
than attending the young children; and assisting to sell the
pottery when carried through the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Query 3rd.&nbsp; <i>Have they any settled abode in
winter</i>, <i>and where</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;C.&nbsp; Their residence, with the exception of a
single family, who some years ago came to <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Kelso, is
at Kirk Yetholm, and chiefly confined to one row of houses, or
street of that town, which goes by the name of Tinkler Row.&nbsp;
Most of them have leases of their possessions, granted for a term
of nineteen times nineteen years, for payment of a small sum
yearly; something of the nature of a quit rent.&nbsp; There is no
tradition in the neighbourhood concerning the time when the
Gypsies first took up their residence at that place, nor whence
they came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of their leases, I believe were granted by the
family of the Bennets of Grubet; the last of whom was Sir David
Bennet, who died about sixty years ago.&nbsp; The late Mr. Nesbit
of Dirleton, then succeeded to the estate, comprehending the
Baronies of Kirk Yetholm, and Grubet.&nbsp; He died about the
year 1783, and not long after, the property was acquired by the
late Lord Tweedale&rsquo;s trustees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the latter part of the life of the late Mr.
Nesbit, he was less frequently at his estate in Roxburghshire
than formerly.&nbsp; He was a great favourite of the Gypsies, and
was <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>in use to call them his body guards,
and often gave them money, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other hand, both the late and present Mr.
Wauchope were of opinion, that the example of these people had a
bad effect upon the morals and industry of the neighbourhood; and
seeing no prospect of their removal, and as little of their
reformation, considered it as a duty to the public, to prevent
the evil increasing; and never would consent to any of the colony
taking up their residence in Town Yetholm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mostly remain at home during winter, but as soon
as the weather becomes tolerably mild in spring, most of them,
men, women, and children, set out on their peregrination over the
country, and live in a state of vagrancy, until again driven into
their habitations by the approach of winter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeming to pride themselves as a separate tribe, they
very seldom intermarry out of the colony; and in rare instances
where that happens, the Gypsey, whether male or female, by
influence and example, always induces the <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>stranger
husband or wife to adopt the manners of the colony, so that no
improvement is ever obtained in that way.&nbsp; The progeny of
such alliances have almost universally the tawny complexion, and
fine black eyes of the Gypsey parent, whether father or
mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So strongly remarkable is the Gypsey cast of
countenance, that even a description of them to a stranger, who
has had no opportunity of formerly seeing them, will enable him
to know them wherever he meets with them.&nbsp; Some individuals,
but very rarely, separate from the colony altogether; and when
they do so early in life, and go to a distance such as London, or
even Edinburgh, their acquaintances in the country get favourable
accounts of them.&nbsp; A few betake themselves to regular and
constant employments at home, but soon tire, and return to their
old way of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When any of them, especially a leader, or man of
influence dies, they have full meetings, not only of the colony,
but of the Gypsies from a distance, and those meetings, or
<i>Late Wakes</i>, are by no means conducted with sobriety or
decency.&rdquo;</p>

taught to read</i>, <i>and what proportion of them</i>?&nbsp;

<p>&ldquo;D.&nbsp; Education being obtained at a cheaper rate,
the Gypsies in general, give their male children as good a one,
as is bestowed on those of the labouring people and farm servants
in the neighbourhood; such as reading, writing, and the first
principles of arithmetic.&nbsp; They all apply to the clergyman
of the parish for baptism to their children, and a strong
superstitious notion universally prevails with them, that it is
unlucky to have an unchristened child long in the house.&nbsp;
Only a very few ever attend divine service, and those as seldom
as they can, just to prevent being refused as sponsors at their
children&rsquo;s baptism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in general, active and lively, particularly
when engaged in field sports; or in such temporary pursuits as
are agreeable to their habits and dispositions; but are destitute
of the perseverance necessary for a settled occupation, or even
for finishing what a moderate degree of continued labour, would
enable them to accomplish in a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>By</i> <span class="smcap">Wm.
Smith</span>, <i>intended to elucidate his answers to the
Queries</i> A <i>and</i> B, <i>on their licentious
liberty</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that about 45 years ago, being then
apprentice to a writer, who was in use to receive the rents as
well as the small duties of Kirk Yetholm, he sent me there with a
list of names, and a statement of what was due; recommending me
to apply to the landlord of the public-house, in the village, for
any information or assistance which I might need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;After waiting a long time, and receiving payment
from most of the feuers, or rentallers, I observed to him that
none of the persons of the names of Faa, Young, Blythe, Fleckie,
&amp;c. who, stood at the bottom of the list for small sums, had
come to meet me, according to the notice given by the Baron
Officer; and proposed sending to inform them that they were
detaining me, and to request their immediate attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord, with a grave face, inquired whether my
master had desired me to ask money from those men.&nbsp; I said,
not particularly; <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>but they stood on the list.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So, I see,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;but had your
master been here himself, he did <i>not dare to ask money from
them</i>, <i>either as rent</i>, <i>or feu duty</i>.&mdash;<i>He
knows that it is as good as if it were in his pocket</i>.&nbsp;
<i>They will pay when their own time comes</i>, <i>but do not
like to pay at a set time with the rest of the Barony</i>; <i>and
still less to be craved</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I accordingly returned without their money, and
reported progress.&nbsp; I found that the landlord was right; my
master said with a smile, that it was unnecessary to send to
them, after the previous notice from the Baron Officer; it was
enough if I had received the money, if offered.&mdash;Their rent
and feu duty was brought to the office in a few weeks.&nbsp; I
need scarcely add, those persons all belonged to the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another instance of their licentious, independent
spirit, occurs to me.&nbsp; The family of Niddry always gave a
decent, annual remuneration to a Baron Baillie, for the purpose
of keeping good order within their Barony of Town Yetholm.&nbsp;
The person whom I remember <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>first in
possession of that office, was an old man called Doctor Walker,
from his being also the village surgeon; and from him I had the
following anecdote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between Yetholm and the border farms in Northumberland,
there were formerly, as in most border situations, some
uncultivated lands called the <i>Plea lands</i>, or <i>Debateable
lands</i>, the pasturage of which was generally eaten up by the
Sorners and vagabonds on both sides of the marches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many years ago, Lord Tankerville and some other of the
English borderers, made their request to Sir David Bennet, and
the late Mr. Wauchope of Niddry, that they would accompany them
at a <i>riding</i> of the Plea lands, who readily complied with
their request.&nbsp; They were induced to this, as they
understood that the Gypsies had taken offence, on the supposition
that they might be circumscribed in the pasture for their
shelties and asses, which they had held a long time, partly by
stealth, and partly by violence.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;Both threats and entreaties were employed to
keep them away; and, at last, Sir David obtained a promise from
some of the heads of the gang, that none of them should show
their faces on the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They, however, got upon the hills at a little distance,
whence they could see every thing that passed.&nbsp; At first
they were very quiet.&nbsp; But when they saw the English Court
Book Spread out on a cushion before the clerk, and apparently
taken in a line of direction, interfering with what they
considered to be their privileged ground, it was with great
difficulty that the most moderate of them, could restrain the
rest from running down, and taking vengeance, even in sight of
their own Lord of the Manor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They only abstained for a short time, and no sooner had
Sir David, and the other gentleman taken leave of each other in
the most polite and friendly manner, as border chiefs are wont to
do, since border feuds ceased, and had departed to a sufficient
distance, than the clan, armed with bludgeons, pitch-forks, and
<!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>such other hostile weapons as they could find, rushed
down in a body; and before the chiefs on either side had reached
their home, there was neither English tenant, horse, cow, nor
sheep left upon the premises.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Notes on Answers C and D.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Peculiar cast of</i> <span class="smcap">Gypsey
Features</span>, <i>every where distinguishable</i>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When first I knew any thing about the colony, old Will
Faa was king, or leader, and had held the sovereignty for many
years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meeting at Kelso with Mr. Walter Scott, whose
discriminating habits and just observations I had occasion to
know from his youth, and at the same time seeing one of my
Yetholm friends in the horse market, I merely said to Mr. Scott,
&ldquo;Try to get before that man with the long drab coat, look
at him on your return, and tell me whether you ever saw him, and
what you think of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was so good as to indulge
me; and rejoining me said without hesitation, &ldquo;I never saw
the man that I know of; but he is one of the Gypsies of Yetholm,
that you told me of several years <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; I need scarcely say that he was
perfectly correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The descendants of Faa, now take the name of
<i>Fall</i>, from the Messrs. Falls, of Dunbar, who, they pride
themselves in saying, are of the same stock and lineage.&nbsp;
When old Will Faa was upwards of eighty years of age, he called
on me at Kelso, in his way to Edinburgh, telling that he was
going to see the Laird, the late Mr. Nesbit, of Dirleton, as he
understood that he was very unwell, and himself being now old,
and not so stout as he had been, he wished to see him once more
before he died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man set out by the nearest road, which was by
no means his common practice.&nbsp; Next market-day, same of the
farmers informed me, that they had been in Edinburgh, and seen
Will Faa upon the bridge; (the south bridge was not then built;)
that he was tossing about his old brown hat, and huzzaing with
great vociferation, that he had seen the Laird before he
died.&nbsp; Indeed Will himself had no time to lose, for having
set his face homewards <!-- page 111--><a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>by the way
of the sea coast, to vary his route, as is the general custom of
the gang, he only got the length of Coldingham, when he was taken
ill, and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His death being notified to his friends at Yetholm,
they and their acquaintance at Berwick, Spittal, Horncliff,
&amp;c. met to pay the last honours to their old leader.&nbsp;
His obsequies were continued three successive days and nights,
and afterwards repeated at Yetholm, whither he was brought for
interment.&nbsp; I cannot say that the funeral rites were
celebrated with decency and sobriety, for that was by no means
the case.&nbsp; This happened in the year 1783, or 1784, and the
late Mr. Nesbit did not long survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Dymock, W. S. Edinburgh, distinguished in the
profession of the law, by his sound judgment and strict
integrity, having had the perusal of the preceding report from
William Smith, gives the following testimony concerning that
account: &ldquo;Baillie Smith&rsquo;s report is quite graphical,
correct truth, and <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>correctly expressed.&mdash;It is
useful as showing, that the parties of Tinklers are great
detachments from one colony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this, accords Sir John Sinclair&rsquo;s observation in
his Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol. II. p. 124, when
describing the village of Eaglesham, he remarks: &ldquo;There is
no magistrate nearer than four miles, and the place is oppressed
with gangs of Gypsies, commonly called Tinklers, or sturdy
beggars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before receiving the very interesting report from William
Smith, the author of this Survey was entirely at a loss to
determine what was become of the descendants of John Faw, who
styled himself Lord and Earl of Little Egypt; and with a numerous
retinue entered Scotland in the reign of Queen Mary, as stated in
Section the 5th.&mdash;His complaint of his men refusing to
return home with him, might be only a feint, invented to cover
his design of continuing in the country; for there does not
appear to be any traces in history of the banishment of Faw-gang,
or of their quitting <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>Scotland.&mdash;But in the above
cited report, we find at the head of the Tinklers a Will Faa, in
whose name there is only a variation of one letter from that of
his distinguished predecessor; and that in reference to this
origin, he asserts the <i>Falls</i> of Dunbar to be of the same
stock and lineage.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">On the origin of the Gypsies</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Various are the conjectures which have been indulged, and the
coincidences which have been sought for, in order to obtain a
solution of the query, <i>What race of people are the
Gypsies</i>?</p>
<p>Whoever is disposed to refer to Continental writers, may see
more than thirty different opinions started on this subject,
founded on no better authority than some similarity of
appellation, garb, complexion, or unsettled way of life.</p>
<p>They were sometimes <i>Torlaques</i>, <i>Kalendars</i>, or
<i>Faquirs</i>.&nbsp; The Torlaques are Mahometan Monks, who
under the pretence of holiness, are guilty of the most flagrant
excesses.&nbsp; Bajazet the 2d, banished them from the Turkish
empire in 1494.&nbsp; The Kalendars <!-- page 116--><a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>wander
about in heathen countries, as the Gypsies do among
Christians.&nbsp; The Faquirs are religious fanatics; and rove
about in heathen and mahometan countries, like the most atrocious
robbers.&nbsp; Anquetil says, the Faquirs in India go a
pilgrimage to Jagrenat; they plunder such villages and cities as
lie in their way; they form considerable bodies about a mile from
Jagrenat, where they choose themselves a leader, to whom they pay
all the attention due to a general.</p>
<p>With regard to strolling and thieving, the Faquirs and Gypsies
agree exactly.&nbsp; Thomasius, Griselini, and the English
geographer Salmon, imagined that when Sultan Selim conquered
Egypt in 1517, several of the natives refusing to submit to the
Turkish yoke, revolted under one Zinganeus.</p>
<p>But we have already adverted to authentic documents for the
proof, that they were in Germany, Italy, and France, near a
century before the conquest of Egypt by Selim.</p>
<p>Yet the belief that Gypsies were of Egyptian origin is
parallel with their existence in Europe.&nbsp; <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>It arose
from the report circulated by the first of them, that they were
pilgrims from Egypt; and this statement was not only adopted by
the common people, but here, and there, obtained credit among men
of learning.&nbsp; Grellmann observes, that had this opinion not
been received at a time when almost every thing was taken upon
trust, with little examination; had it not been propagated by the
first Gypsies, and then obtained a sanction, it would have been
impossible for it to have gained such general acceptation, or to
have maintained itself to the present times.&nbsp; Till the 17th
century, the Egyptian descent of the Gypsies rested entirely on
tradition.&nbsp; Afterwards, Aventin, Krantz, and Miinster openly
contradict it.</p>
<p>Aventin relates that they wished it to be thought they came
from that country, but that, in his time, nothing was known
concerning them, but what came from their own mouths; those who
accounted them Egyptians, rested their belief entirely on the
veracity of their informants.</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>This is collected with greater certainty from Krantz
and Miinster, for they declare expressly, that every thing which
could be discovered by any other means than their own assertions,
contradicted, rather than confirmed their Egyptian descent.&nbsp;
But it is not merely that their Egyptian descent is entirely
destitute of proof, the most circumstantial evidence can be
adduced against it.</p>
<p>Their language differs entirely from the Coptic, and their
customs, as Ahasuerus Fritsch has remarked, are diametrically
opposite to the Egyptian; but what is, if possible, of greater
weight, they wander about in Egypt, like strangers, and
<i>there</i>, as in other countries, form a distinct people.</p>
<p>The testimony of Bellonius is full and decisive on the
point.&nbsp; He states; &ldquo;No part of the world, I believe,
is free from those banditti, wandering about in troops; whom we,
by mistake, call Gypsies, and Bohemians.&nbsp; When we were at
Cairo, and the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of
these strolling <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>thieves sitting under palm-trees;
and they are <i>esteemed foreigners</i> in
<i>Egypt</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aventin expressly makes Turkey their original place of
rendezvous; and this furnishes a reason for the south east parts
of Europe being the most crowded with them.&nbsp; If all that
came to Europe passed by this route, it accounts for a greater
number remaining in those countries, than in others to which they
would have a much longer travel; and before their arrival at
which, their hordes might be much divided.</p>
<p>It is a just assertion, that one of the most infallible
methods of determining the origin of a people, would be the
discovery of a country in which their language is that of the
natives.&nbsp; It is a fact incontrovertibly established, that
besides the Gypsies speaking the language of the country in which
they live, they have a general one of their own, in which they
converse with each other.</p>
<p>Not knowing any speech correspondent with the Gypsies, some
have been ready to pronounce it a mere jargon; not considering
how extravagant <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>a surmise it would be, that a people
rude, uncivilized, and separated hundreds of miles from each
other, have invented a language.&nbsp; Others who are better
informed on the subject, allow that the language brought into
Europe with the Gypsies, was really vernacular, of some country;
but suppose it is so disguised and corrupted, partly by design,
and partly by adventitious events, through length of time, and
the continued wandering of these people, that it must be
considered a new language, and now used by the Gypsies only.</p>
<p>That it is the dialect of some particular part of the globe,
though no longer pure, as in the country whence it originated, is
an opinion which has obtained the greatest concurrence among the
learned.&nbsp; Grellmann says, had a German listened a whole day
to a Gypsey conversation, he would not have comprehended a single
expression.&nbsp; It must doubtless appear extraordinary, that
the language of a people who had lived for centuries in Europe,
should have remained so much a secret: but it was not easy to
gain information from the Gypsies <!-- page 121--><a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>concerning
it.&nbsp; Acquainted, by tradition, with the deception their
predecessors practised on coming into Europe, they are
suspicious; and fearing an explanation might be dangerous to
themselves, they are not disposed to be communicative.&mdash;But
how was it possible for the learned of former centuries, to be
competent to the investigation, who had not the aids which now so
copiously occur to the historical etymologist?</p>
<p>Many dialects have been discovered, and our knowledge of
others greatly increased, within the last fifty or sixty
years.&nbsp; During that time, not only the literary treasures of
the furthest north have been opened to us, but we have become
acquainted with many of the oriental languages; and even eastern
idioms are becoming familiar to us.&nbsp; We need not therefore
be surprised, that before this period, the most learned were
unable to point out the country in which the Gypsey language was
spoken.&nbsp; The Gypsies have no writing peculiar to themselves,
in which to give a specimen of the construction of their
dialect.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>Writing and reading are attainments not to be expected
from nomadic tribes.&nbsp; Sciences, and the refined arts, are
never to be looked for among a people whose manner of living, and
education, are so irregular.&nbsp; Music is the only science in
which Gypsies participate in any considerable degree; they
likewise compose, but it is after the manner of the eastern
people, extempore.</p>
<p>Grellmann asserts, that the Hindostanie language has the
greatest affinity with that of the Gypsies; but he does not rest
this solely on the specimen he has introduced, a sketch of which
will be presented in the next section; he adduces many facts in
confirmation of his opinion, which it would be an injustice to
him not to exhibit.</p>
<p>He infers from the following considerations, that Gypsies are
of the lowest class of Indians, namely Pariars, or as they are
called in Hindostan, <i>Suders</i>.</p>
<p>The whole great nation of Indians is known to be divided into
four ranks, or stocks, which are called by a portuguese name,
<i>castes</i>; each <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of which has its own particular
subdivisions.&nbsp; Of these castes, the Bramin is the first; the
second contains the <i>Tschechteries</i> or Setreas; the third,
consists of the <i>Beis</i>, or Wazziers; the fourth is the caste
of the above mentioned Suders; who upon the peninsula of Malabar,
where their condition is the same as in Hindostan, are called
Parias, and Pariers.</p>
<p>The first were appointed by Brama to seek after knowledge, to
give instructions, and to take care of religion.&nbsp; The second
were to serve in war; the third were as the Bramins, to cultivate
science; but particularly to attend to the breeding of
cattle.&nbsp; The caste of Suders was to be subservient to the
Bramins, the Tschecteries, and the Beis.&nbsp; These Suders are
held in disdain, they are considered infamous, and unclean, from
their occupation, and they are abhorred because they eat flesh;
the three other castes living entirely on vegetables.</p>
<p>Of this very caste it will appear, by the following
comparison, our Gypsies are composed.&nbsp; We have seen that the
Gypsies are in the highest degree filthy and disgusting; and with
<!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>regard to character, depraved and fraudulent to excess,
and these are the qualities of the Suders.</p>
<p>Baldeus says, the Parias are a filthy people, and wicked crew,
who in winter steal much cattle, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It is related in the Danish Mission Intelligence:&mdash;Nobody
can deny that the Pariers are the dregs and refuse of all the
Indians; they are thievish, and have wicked dispositions,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Moreover Neuhof assures us: &ldquo;The Parruas are full of
every kind of dishonesty; they do not consider lying and cheating
to be sinful, as they have no other custom or maxims among
them.&nbsp; The Gypsey&rsquo;s solicitude to conceal his language
is, also, a striking Indian trait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Pallas says of the Indians round Astracan:
custom has rendered them to the greatest degree suspicious about
their language, insomuch that I was never able to obtain a small
vocabulary from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to Gypsey marriages, Salmon relates that the
nearest relations cohabit with <!-- page 125--><a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>each other;
and as to education, their children grow up in the most shameful
neglect, without either discipline or instruction.</p>
<p>All this is precisely the case with the Pariars.&nbsp; In the
journal of the Missionaries already quoted, it is said;
&ldquo;With respect to matrimony, they act like the beasts, and
their children are brought up without restraint or
information.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gypsies are fond of being about horses,
so are the Suders in India, for which reason, they are commonly
employed as horse-keepers, by the Europeans resident in that
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have seen that the Gypsies hunt after cattle which have
died of distempers, in order to feed on them; and when they can
procure more of the flesh than is sufficient for one day&rsquo;s
consumption, they dry it in the sun.&nbsp; Such is likewise a
constant custom with the Pariars in India.</p>
<p>That the Gypsies, and natives of Hindostan, resemble each
other in complexion, and shape is undeniable.&nbsp; And what is
asserted of the young Gypsey girls rambling about with their
fathers who are musicians, dancing with lascivious <!-- page
126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>and indecent gestures, to divert any person who is
willing to give them a small gratuity for so acting, is likewise
perfectly Indian.&nbsp; Sonnerat confirms this in the account he
gives of the dancing girls of Surat.</p>
<p>Fortune-telling is practised all over the East; but the
peculiar kind professed by the Gypsies, viz: chiromancy,
constantly referring to whether the parties shall be rich or
poor, happy or unhappy in marriage, &amp;c. is no where met with
but in India.</p>
<p>The account we have given of Gypsey smiths may be compared
with the Indian, as related by Sonnerat in the following words:
&ldquo;The smith carries his tools, his shop, and his forge about
with him, and works in any place where he can find employment; he
erects his shop before the house of his employer, raising a low
wall with beaten earth; before which, he places his hearth;
behind this wall, he fixes two leathern bellows.&nbsp; He has a
stone instead of an anvil, and his whole apparatus is a pair of
tongs, a hammer, a beetle, and a file.&nbsp; How <!-- page
127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>exactly does this accord with the description of the
Gypsey smith!</p>
<p>We have seen that Gypsies always choose their place of
residence near some village, or city, very seldom within them;
even though there may not be any order to prevent it, as is the
case in Moldavia, Wallachia, and all parts of Turkey.&nbsp; Even
the more improved Gypsies in Transylvania, who have long since
discontinued the wandering mode of life, and might, with
permission from government, reside within the cities, rather
choose to build their huts in some bye place, without their
limits.&nbsp; This custom appears to be derived from their
original Suder education; it being usual all over India, for the
Sunders to have their huts without the villages of the other
castes, and in retired places near their cities.</p>
<p>With respect to religion, it has appeared that the greater
part of the Gypsies live without any profession of it;
<i>Tollius</i> says, worse than heathens.&nbsp; The more
wonderful it is, that a whole people should be so indifferent and
void of religion, the more weight it carries with <!-- page
128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>it, to confirm their Indian origin, when all this is
found to be literally true of the Suders.</p>
<p>In relation to the emigration of the Gypsies, no cause can be
assigned for their leaving their native country, so probable, as
the war of Timur Beg, in India.&nbsp; The date of their arrival
marks it very plainly.&nbsp; It was in the years 1408, and 1409,
that this Conqueror ravaged India for the purpose of
disseminating the Mahometan religion.&nbsp; Not only every one
who made any resistance was destroyed, and such as fell into the
enemies&rsquo; hands, though quite defenceless, were made slaves;
but in a short time those very slaves, to the number of one
hundred thousand, were put to death.&nbsp; In consequence of the
universal panic which took place, those, who could quit the
country, might well be supposed to consult their safety by
flight.</p>
<p>If any of the higher castes did withdraw themselves on account
of the troubles it is probable, they retired southward to people
of their own sort, the Mahrattas.&nbsp; To mix at all with the
Suders, would have been degrading <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>their high
characters, which they consider worse than death; it was
therefore morally impossible for them to have united with the
Suders in a retreat.&nbsp; Moreover, by putting themselves into
the power of the Suders, with whom they live in a state of
discord and inveteracy, they might have incurred as much danger
as from the common enemy.</p>
<p>Before presenting a vocabulary of Gypsey words, it may be
observed, that though the Hindostanie language is fundamentally
the same, all over Hindostan; yet, like other languages, it has
different dialects in the various provinces.&nbsp; The eastern
dialect, spokes about the Ganges, has different names for some
things; and inflections of some words different to the western
ones spoken about the Indus: There is, besides, a third, varying
from both these, viz: the Surat dialect, which has a number of
Malabar, and other words mixed with it.&nbsp; To this must be
added, that in the Hindostan, as well as in every other language,
there are often several names for the same thing.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>The particular dialect bearing the closest affinity to
the Gypsey language, as will appear hereafter, is the western;
and perhaps more especially that of Surat.&nbsp; With respect to
the construction and inflections of the two languages, they are
evidently the same.&nbsp; In that of Hindostan, every word ending
in j is feminine, all the rest masculine; the Gypsey is the
same.&nbsp; That makes the inflections entirely by the article,
adding it at the end of the word.&nbsp; The Gypsey language
proceeds exactly in the same manner</p>

133</span>It has already been observed, that in the Gypsey, as
well as in the Hindostanie language, the article is not placed
before the noun, but affixed behind it; and that is the sole
indication of the case of a noun.</p>
<p>Grellmann has given examples of the declension of nouns,
pronouns, and adjectives, as well as the conjugation of verbs in
both languages; but the grammatical arrangement of them does not
come within the design of this work.&nbsp; The foregoing list of
words is a selection of those that are most similar: but in
Grellmann&rsquo;s extensive vocabulary, he says, it will appear
on the average, that every third Gypsey word, is likewise
Hindostanie.</p>
<p>It must be observed, that the words above recited, have been
learned from the Gypsies within a few years, consequently at a
time when they had been nearly four complete centuries away from
Hindostan, their native country; and among people who spoke
languages totally different; in which also the Gypsies
conversed.</p>
<p><!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Under the constant and so long continued influx of
these languages, their own must necessarily have suffered some
alteration; more especially as they are a people entirely
ignorant, either of writing or literature.</p>
<p>It does not appear that there is so much Persian in the Gypsey
language, as has been generally imagined; and even what there is
of it, they may have brought with them from their native country,
as many Persian words are current in Hindostan.&nbsp; We ought
rather to wonder the number of Hindostanie words in the Gypsey
language, is so considerable, than to require it should be
greater, to furnish sufficient proof of the Hindostanie language
being the Gypsies&rsquo; mother tongue.</p>
<p>Since the laborious researches of Grellmann, extended
intercourse with India, has furnished unquestionable evidence in
support of his deductions.&nbsp; The first we shall introduce, is
contained in the following letter from William Marsden to Sir
Joseph Banks, F.R.S. read to the Society of Antiquaries in
London, 1785.</p>
<p><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>&ldquo;It has long been surmised, that the vagrant
tribes of people called in this country Gypsies, and on parts of
the Continent of Europe, Cingari, Zingari, and Chingali, were of
eastern origin.&nbsp; The former name has been supposed a
corruption of Egyptian, and some learned men have judged it not
improbable that their language might be traced to the Coptic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the course of researches which I have had occasion
to pursue on the subject of language, I have observed that
Ludolfus, in his history of Ethiopia, makes mention incidentally
of the Cingari, vel <i>Errones Nubiani</i>, and gives a specimen
of words which he had collected from these people on his travels,
with a view of determining their origin.&nbsp; He discusses the
opinions of various writers concerning them; but forms no precise
sentiment of his own, concluding his observations with these
words: &ldquo;Eadem vocabula, cum maximam partem reperiam apud
Vulcanium &agrave; centum fere annis traditam, non fictitia
existimo, ut Megiferus putat nec corrupta ex aliis linguis, <!--
page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>neque Egyptiaca, sive Coptica.&rdquo;&mdash;In English,
thus: &ldquo;Since I find according to Vulcanius, that most of
these words have been continued traditionally for a period of
nearly 100 years, I do not consider them fictitious, as Megiferus
supposes, nor corrupted from other languages, either the Egyptian
or Coptic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was surprised to find many of the words familiar to
my eye; and I pointed out to Sir Joseph Banks, in the latter end
of the year 1783, their evident correspondence with terms in the
Hindostanie, or as it is vulgarly termed in India, the
Moors&rsquo; language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This similitude appeared to me so extraordinary, that I
was inclined to suspect an error in the publication, which might
have arisen from a confusion of obscure vocabularies in the
author&rsquo;s possession.&nbsp; The circumstance, however,
determined me to pay farther attention to the subject, and to
examine, in the first place, whether the language spoken by the
Gypsey tribes in England, and by those in the remoter parts of
the continent of Europe was one, and the same; and then to
ascertain, <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>whether this actually bore the
affinity which so forcibly struck me in Ludolfus, to any of the
languages on the Continent of India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the obliging assistance of Sir Joseph Banks,
who has spared no pains to promote this investigation, I procured
an opportunity of obtaining a list of words from our Gypsies,
which I can depend upon as genuine, and tolerably accurate in
respect to the pronunciation, from their being corroborated also
by words taken down, separately, by Sir Joseph, and by Dr.
Blagden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Matra did me the favour to transmit for me, a list
of words to Turkey; and from his ingenious friend B. Pisani, I
received a complete and satisfactory translation of them,
together with some information, respecting the manners of the
Chingiares, in the Turkish dominions, which, however, does not
come within the design of this paper, as I mean to confine myself
in the present communication, simply to the question of
similarity of language; which, if established, I should esteem a
matter <!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>of no little curiosity; presuming it
to be perfectly new to the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of this similarity, the learned members of the Society
will be enabled to form their judgment from the annexed paper,
exhibiting a comparison of a few of the words procured from the
different quarters before mentioned, with the Hindostanie terms,
from the best published, and parole authorities.&nbsp; It may not
be unworthy of remark, that the general appellation of these
people in the eastern part of Europe, is very nearly connected
with that of the inhabitants of Ceylon, in the East-Indies, who
are equally termed.&nbsp; Lingalese and Chingalese; though at the
same time it must be acknowledged, that the language of this
Island has much less correspondence with that of the Gypsies,
than many others of the Indian dialects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Grace, the Archbishop of York, with his usual
discernment, suggested to me, the probability that the Zingara
here spoken of, may have derived their name, and perhaps their
origin from the people called Langari, or <!-- page 139--><a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Langarians,
who are found in the north-west parts of the Peninsula of
Hindostan, and infest the coasts of Guzerat and Sindy with their
piratical depredations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maritime turn of this numerous race of people, with
their roving and enterprising disposition, may warrant the idea
of occasional emigration in their boats, by the coarse of the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the resemblance to the Hindostanie, is
the predominant feature in the Gypsey dialect, yet there are
words interspersed, which evidently coincide with other
languages.&nbsp; Besides the Mahratta, and Bengalese, which I
have marked in the comparative specimen, it is not a little
singular that the terms for the numerals <i>seven</i>,
<i>eight</i>, and <i>nine</i>, are purely Greek: although the
first five, and that for ten, are indisputably Indian.&nbsp; It
is also a curious observation, that although the Indian term for
seven is <i>saath</i>, yet that for a week, or seven days; is the
Eftan of the latter.</p>
<p><!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;One word only among those I have examined, bears
a resemblance to the Coptic, which is <i>rom</i>, the same with
<i>romi</i>, a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In comparisons of this nature, a due allowance must be
made, not only for the various modes of spelling adopted by
different persons, and different nations, but also for the
dissimilar manner in which the same individual sound, strikes the
organs of the hearers; of which some pointed instances may be
given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should any be inclined to doubt, which I scarcely
suppose possible, the identity of the Gypsey, or Cingari, and the
Hindostanie languages, still it will be acknowledged as no
uninteresting subject, that tribes wandering through the
mountains of Nubia, or the plains of Romania, have conversed for
centuries in a dialect precisely similar to that spoken at this
day, by, the obscure, despised, and wretched people in England,
whose language has been considered as a fabricated gibberish, and
confounded with a cant in use among thieves and beggars; and
whose persons have been, till <!-- page 141--><a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>within the
period of a year, an object of the persecution, instead of the
protection of our laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the 386th page of the 7th Vol. of Arch&aelig;ologia, is the
comparative view of the English Gypsey, Turkish Gypsey, and
Hindostanie dialects; a specimen of which will be presented in
this section.</p>
<p>In page 387 of the same volume, are collections on the
Zingara, or Gypsey language, by Jacob Bryant, Esq. transmitted to
G. Salusbury Brereton, Esq. in a letter from Doctor Douglas, read
1785: This learned traveller, when in Hungary, had taken from the
mouths of Gypsies, specimens of their language, which occupy
seven pages.&nbsp; It is remarkable, that of seventeen words
obtained and enumerated in the letters of Coxe, the learned
traveller, fourteen appear to resemble most exactly those of the
same signification, collected by Jacob Bryant</p>

page 432, observes: &ldquo;The Gypsies, as it should seem from
some striking proofs derived from their language, were originally
from Hindostan, where they are supposed to have been of the
lowest class of Indians, named Pariars, or as they are called in
Hindostan, Suders.&nbsp; They are thought to have emigrated about
A.D. 1408, or 1409, when Timur Beg ravaged India for the purpose
of spreading the Mahometan religion.&nbsp; On this occasion so
many were made slaves, and put to death, that a universal panic
took place, <!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 144</span>and a very great number of terrified
inhabitants endeavoured to save themselves by flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As every part to the north and east was beset by the
enemy, it is most probable that the country below Multan, to the
mouth of the Indus, was the first asylum and rendezvous of the
fugitive Suders.&nbsp; This is called the country of
Zinganen.&nbsp; Here they were safe, and remained so till
Timur&rsquo;s return from the victory of the Ganges.&nbsp; Then
it was that they entirely quitted the country, and probably with
them a considerable number of the natives, which will explain the
meaning of their original name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the seventh Vol. of the Asiatic Researches, page 470,
Captain David Richardson says of the <i>Panchperee</i>, or
Budee&rsquo;a Nuts: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis probable there will be
found in their manners, a stronger similitude to the Gypsies of
Europe, than in those of any other which may come under
review.&nbsp; They have no particular system of religion,
adopting with indifference that of the village near to which they
happen to be encamped.&nbsp; In the upper provinces of Hindostan,
the little encampments of these people <!-- page 145--><a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>are
frequently very regular and neat, being there formed of the
Sirkee entirely.&nbsp; Each apartment, though not much larger
than a mastiff&rsquo;s kennel, has its own particular enclosure,
or court-yard; generally erected in such a manner, as to become a
species of circumvallation to the whole portable hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot help wondering where so many men, women, and
children, and other domestic animals manage to sleep; or shelter
themselves from the storms which sometimes assail these itinerant
people.&nbsp; The men are remarkably athletic and active, and
also nimble and adroit, in every kind of slight of hand.&nbsp;
Many of the subdivisions of this class of men, pay little, or no
attention to cleanliness, or any restrictions in diet; eating
dead jackalls, bullocks, horses, or any kind of food
procurable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women do not attend the men during their juggling
exploits, but have a peculiar department allotted to themselves;
which consists of the practice of physic, cupping, palmistry,
curing disorders of the teeth, and marking the skin of the Hindoo
women, an <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>operation termed Godna.&nbsp; They
have two languages peculiar to themselves; one intended for the
use only of the craftsman, the other general among men, women,
and children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hindostanie is the basis of both; the first is
general, being a mere transposition or change of syllables; and
the second apparently, a systematic conversion of a few letters;
but which will be best elucidated by the following specimen,
which contains twenty-two words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which, he says: &ldquo;I find these people in
Colebrook&rsquo;s arrangement of the Hindoo Classes, mentioned in
the sixth class, under the head of <i>Nata</i>, Bazeegurs; and in
Sir William Jones&rsquo;s translation of the Ordinances of Menu,
<i>Munoo</i>, Chapter 10.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall now subjoin a short parallel between the
Gypsies of Europe, and the people I have described.&nbsp; Both
the <i>Gypsies</i> and the <i>Nuts</i> are generally a wandering
race of beings, seldom having a fixed habitation.&nbsp; They have
each a language peculiar to themselves.&nbsp; That of the Gypsies
is undoubtedly a species of Hindostanie; <!-- page 147--><a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>as well as
that of the Nuts.&nbsp; In Europe, it answers all the purposes of
concealment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gypsies have their King, the Nuts their <i>Nardar
Boutoh</i>; they are equally formed into companies, and their
peculiar employments are exactly similar; dancing, singing,
music, palmistry, &amp;c.&nbsp; They are both considered as
thieves; at least that division of the Nuts, whose manners come
nearest the Gypsies.&mdash;In matters of religion they appear
equally indifferent, and as to food, we have seen that neither
the Gypsies nor the Budee&rsquo;a Nuts are very choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though, in the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,
Grellmann&rsquo;s Theory is thought slightly of, the similarity
of language being deemed but inconclusive evidence; yet in this
instance, and even in opposition to such authority, I will
venture to consider it, as forming a basis of the most
substantial kind.&nbsp; It is not the accidental coincidence of a
few words, but the whole vocabulary he produces, differs not so
much from the common Hindostanie, as provincial dialects of the
same country do from each other.</p>
<p><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&ldquo;Grellmann, from a want of knowledge in the
Hindostanie; as to its provincial dialects, lost many
opportunities of producing the proper word in comparison with the
Gypsey one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following list of words was taken from the Annual
Register of 1784, or 1785, with a few I have now subjoined from
Grellmann.&mdash;In some of the instances where he has failed of
producing the corresponding Hindostanie word, the supply of them
will, I hope, prove the language of the Gypsies, and that of
Hindostan to be the same, or very intimately connected with each
other.</p>

<h2><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>SECTION IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Present state the Gypsies in England.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It has been already stated, in the Introduction to this work,
that the author visited an encampment of Gypsies.&nbsp; It
consisted of five tents, situated near Rushden, within two miles
of the pleasant town of Higham Ferrers.&nbsp; He did not
reconnoitre the camp till about mid-day, having been informed
that by this time, it was probable, the able-bodied persons of
both sexes would be drawn off to a feast and a fair, in different
situations, not very distant.&nbsp; It proved so; there were only
two women, three children, and an infant remaining in the tents;
which were the residence of several branches of the numerous
families of Smith, and Loversedge, names well known in the county
of Northampton.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>The head of the former, has been many years a dealer in
asses, or donkies; and is reputed to be possessed of some
property.&nbsp; His wife, more than eighty years of age, was
seated at the entrance of one of the tents, weaving a cabbage
net.&nbsp; The other woman, who was middle aged, was nursing an
infant; and the eldest of the children, about twelve years of
age, was making preparation for washing; a pan was suspended from
three poles, under which she had kindled a fire, to boil
water.&nbsp; The very tattered and squalid appearance of this
poor girl was truly affecting.</p>
<p>On conversing with the old woman, she said she had forty
grand-children; some gone to the feast, others to the fair; and
she signified, that both men and women were musical
performers.</p>
<p>On being asked whether any of them had learned to read, she
shook her head, and, with apparent regret, acknowledged they had
not.&nbsp; This indication of concern excited an idea, that some
impression had been made on the minds even of Gypsies, of the
disadvantages their children were under.</p>
<p><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Considering how generally education had been extended,
to the lowest description of every other class of British
subjects; how many schools had been opened in villages, as well
as in the different towns of the kingdom, it was not improbable,
that information of movements so extraordinary, might have
reached the ears, if not impressed the minds of these neglected
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; The activity which had been subsequently
displayed in the distribution of the Scriptures, and the zeal
excited among the most ignorant to receive them, might also come
to their knowledge.</p>
<p>Resuming conversation with the female head of the Smith
family, she said they endured great hardships in winter, having
no shelter but their tents, in the worst of weather.</p>
<p>She was then asked, if they did not experience great
difficulty in obtaining the means of subsistence, during the
inclement seasons; and whether they were not, at times, reduced
to the necessity of taking up with any kind of sustenance, even
if it consisted of animals they might find dead upon the
road.</p>
<p><!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>To this she immediately replied: &ldquo;Those that have
died by the hand of God, are better than those that have died by
the hand of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reply, corresponding so exactly with that of the
Continental Gypsies, presents a remarkable trait of their mutual
descent from the Suder caste.</p>
<p>Some of the peculiarities in Gypsey habits to which we have
just now adverted, had not escaped the observation of that
accurate delineator of men and manners, our celebrated poet,
Cowper; as will appear by the following sketch:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I see a column of slow rising smoke,<br
/>
O&rsquo;er-top the lofty wood, that skirts the wild.<br />
A vagabond and useless tribe, there eat<br />
Their miserable meal.&nbsp; A Kettle<br />
Slung between two poles, upon a stick transverse,<br />
Receives the morsel: flesh <i>obscene</i> of hog,<br />
Or <i>vermin</i>; or, at best, of cock purloined<br />
From his accustom&rsquo;d perch.&nbsp; Hard faring race,<br />
They pick their fuel out of every hedge,<br />
Which kindled with dry leaves, and wood, just saves<br />
The spark of life.&nbsp; The sportive wind blows wide<br />
Their fluttering rags, and shows a tawney skin,<br />
The vellum of the pedigree they claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>Before the Gypsey&rsquo;s acknowledgment, of preferring
the flesh of animals which have died by disease, or what is
called a natural death, the writer of this section, knew not how
to credit the general testimony of the farmers and inhabitants of
Northamptonshire, that they did not find the Gypsies committed
any depredations on their property, unless it was in pilfering
wood from the fences.&nbsp; He now thinks it probable, that
others, who were unacquainted with this singular idea of the
Gypsies, respecting animal food, may have imagined they were
guilty of many more thefts for subsistence, than is really the
case.</p>
<p>In the further progress of his inquiries, the writer has met
with various instances in which confidence reposed in Gypsies,
has not been disappointed.&mdash;He will mention a remarkable one
at Feringbury, near Coggeshall, in Essex, on a farm which had
been occupied by three generations of the family of Corders;
during which time, not the least loss had been sustained, by
accommodating Gypsies with lodgings in their barns and out-houses
during <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>inclement weather; but, on the
contrary, the family have considered them a protection to their
property.</p>
<p>After the success of an experiment like the above, it would be
superfluous to ask, if it is not sounder policy to excite the
good, than the bad dispositions of human nature.</p>
<p>Must not the torrent of invective and abuse, almost
universally poured upon this people, tend to disaffect and
indispose them to civil association!&nbsp; Despised and
ill-treated as they often are, have they not reason to imagine
the hand of every man to be against them?&nbsp; Who then can
wonder at their eluding, as much as possible, the inquiries of
strangers!</p>
<p>Looking at their condition among the various inhabitants of
Europe, dignified with the Christian name, the writer has often
been reminded of the universality of the Gospel call, as
illustrated in the parable of the great supper.&nbsp; After the
invitation had been given throughout the streets and lanes of the
cities, the command to the servants was: &ldquo;Go out into the
highways and hedges, and compel them to come in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<!-- page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>Here is a description that may have been intended
specially to apply to this people, so exactly and even literally
adapted to their condition, in all countries, is the language:
&ldquo;Go ye into the highways and hedges.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
distinction in their case is rendered still more remarkable by
the very pressing injunction, &ldquo;Compel them to come
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does it not admit of the inference, that as outcasts of
society, being under greater disadvantages than the other incited
classes, their situation requited a more powerful stimulus to be
applied?</p>
<p>The account of the sufferings of Gypsies in winter, having
been confirmed by many concurring testimonies, from the
inhabitants of Northamptonshire, the following Circular was sent
into most of the Counties of England, with a view to ascertain
their state in other parts of the nation.</p>
<h3><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>CIRCULAR.</h3>
<p>When it is considered how much the exertions of the wise, the
philanthropic, and the good, in all parts of the nation, have
been directed to advancing the morals and religious instruction
of the lower orders of the community, it appears almost
incredible that one description of British subjects, and of all
others the most abject and depraved, should have been either
entirely overlooked or neglected.&nbsp; The Gypsies, to whom this
applies, are a people which, more than any other, it might have
been considered the interest of society to reclaim, because of
the depredations they commit upon it.</p>
<p>The efforts of the good, and of the great, have not been
confined to meliorating the condition of the inhabitants of this
country only, they have been directed to the alleviation of human
misery in various other nations, and even to the augmentation of
funds for civilizing the natives of distant regions of the
globe.&nbsp; <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Can we manifest our solicitude for
the improvement of our fellow-creatures separated from us
thousands of miles, whose faces we never saw, and conclude that
numbers of persons in our own country, whose situation is more
desperate, have not a peculiar claim on our consideration?</p>
<p>To reclaim the Indians of North America from their wild and
roving course of life, associations have been formed to give them
instructions in agriculture, and to supply them with implements
of husbandry; plans of education adapted to their untutored state
have been arranged, and persons qualified to carry them into
effect, in the establishment of schools, have gone to their
assistance.</p>
<p>Do the numerous Gypsey tribes of England possess any of these
advantages?</p>
<p>In the summer of 1814, when the writer of this circular,
visited a number of Gypsey tents in Northamptonshire, as already
stated, a woman about 80 years of age, who had forty
grand-children, acknowledged, that not one of them had been
taught to read.&nbsp; In this land <!-- page 160--><a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>of
Christian benevolence, can we pronounce a certain proportion of
its inhabitants to be wretchedly depraved, and even a wicked set
of people; advertise them as rogues and vagabonds, and offer a
reward for their apprehension, without devising any means of
remedying the defects of their habits, or holding out
encouragement to reformation, in any of them who are disposed to
relinquish their vicious courses?</p>
<p>The associations formed and forming in different parts of the
nation for the prosecution of felons, render the condition of
Gypsies every day more and more deplorable, by their being hunted
like beasts of prey from township to township.</p>
<p>The last winter but one, a company of these houseless
wanderers were dug out of the snow in Ditchford Lane, near
Irchester, Northamptonshire, when it appeared one woman had been
lying in, and that an old man was dying.</p>
<p>If those who have been zealous in driving them from their
accustomed haunts, were to place themselves, if but ideally in
their situation, <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>can we believe, that instead of
augmenting their sufferings, they would not be disposed to
commiserate their case, and even attend to the precept of the
Christian Legislator: &ldquo;Whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is worse than
useless and unavailing to harrass them from place to place, when
no retreat or shelter is provided for their refuge.</p>
<p>A writer on this subject, under the designation of Junius, in
the Northampton Mercury of June 27th, 1814, observes: &ldquo;When
we consider the immense sums raised for every probable means of
doing good, which have hitherto been made public, we cannot
doubt, if a proper method should be proposed for the relief and
ameliorating the state of these people, it would meet with
deserved encouragement.&nbsp; Suppose that the Legislature should
think them not unworthy its notice; and as a part of the great
family, they ought not to be overlooked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another
writer in the Northampton Mercury of July the 21st of the last
year, on the necessity of some plan <!-- page 162--><a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>being
adopted for their advantage, remarks, thereby &ldquo;thousands of
our fellow-creatures would be raised from depravity and
wretchedness to a state of comfort; the private property of
individuals be much more secure, and the public materially
benefited.&rdquo;&nbsp; In addition to these observations, it may
be asked, Would not the providing of an education for their
children, to which they should be induced to conform, and the
apprenticing of them, at a proper age, to suitable trades, enable
the rising generation to correct the errors of Gypsey habits?</p>
<p>With a view to ascertain more fully the extent in which this
may be necessary, the friends of humanity, to whom this Circular
may be addressed, are requested to co-operate with others of
their friends in different parts of each county, for procuring
answers from the best informed of the Gypsies, and others, to the
subsequent questions.&nbsp; And should there be any person in
their neighbourhood, who after being brought up among the
Gypsies, hath quitted them for a more settled course of life,
<!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>information from such is particularly desirable.&nbsp;
Answers are requested in the course of the summer: to be sent to
John Hoyland, Springfield, Sheffield.</p>

of the Circular</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; All Gypsies suppose the first of them came from
Egypt.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They cannot form any idea of the number in
England.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Gypsies of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, parts of
Buckinghamshire, Cambridge, and Huntingdonshire, are continually
making revolutions within the range of those counties.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; They are either ignorant of the number of Gypsies in
the counties through which they travel, or unwilling to disclose
their knowledge.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The most common names are Smith, Cooper, Draper,
Taylor, Bosswel, Lee, Lovell, Loversedge, Allen, Mansfield,
Glover, Williams, Carew, Martin, Stanley, Buckley, Plunkett,
Corrie.</p>
<p>6 &amp; 7.&nbsp; The gangs in different towns have not any
regular connection, or organization; <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>but those
who take up their winter quarters in the same city or town,
appear to have some knowledge of the different routes each horde
will pursue; probably with a design to prevent interference.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; In the county of Herts, it is computed there may be
sixty families, having many children.&nbsp; Whether they are
quite so numerous in Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, and
Northamptonshire, the answers are not sufficiently definite to
determine.&nbsp; In Cambridgeshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire,
Wiltshire, and Dorsetshire, greater numbers are calculated
upon.&nbsp; In various counties, the attention has not been
competent to procuring data for any estimate of families, or
individuals.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; More than half their number follow no business;
others are dealers in horses and asses; farriers, smiths,
tinkers, braziers, grinders of cutlery, basket-makers,
chair-bottomers, and musicians.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Children are brought up in the habits of their
parents, particularly to music and dancing, and are of dissolute
conduct.</p>

<p>12.&nbsp; Too indolent to have acquired accounts of genealogy,
and perhaps indisposed to it by the irregularity of their
habits.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; In most counties there are particular situations to
which they are partial.&nbsp; In Berkshire is a marsh, near
Newbury, much frequented by them; and Dr. Clarke states, that in
Cambridgeshire, their principal rendezvous is near the western
villages.</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; It cannot be ascertained, whether from their first
coming into the nation, attachment to particular places has
prevailed.</p>

inquiries respecting their peculiar language, calling it
gibberish.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t know of any person that can write
it, or of any written specimen of it.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 168</span>beyond repeating the Lord&rsquo;s
prayer; and only a few of them are capable of that.&nbsp;
Instances of their attending any place for warship are very
rare.</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; They marry for the most part by pledging to each
other, without any ceremony.&nbsp; A few exceptions have occurred
when money was plentiful.</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; They do not teach their children religion.</p>
<p>22 &amp; 23.&nbsp; Not <i>one</i> in a <i>thousand</i> can

<p>24 &amp; 25.&nbsp; Some go into lodgings in London, Cambridge,
&amp;c. during winter; but it is calculated three-fourths of them
live out of doors in winter, as in summer.</p>
<p>Most of the answers are confirmed by Riley Smith, who, during
many years, was accounted the chief of the Gypsies in
Northamptonshire.&nbsp; He being much in request by some of the
principal inhabitants of that county, as a musician, had the
address to marry the cook out of one of their families, and
afterward obtained a farm near Bedford; but being unsuccessful in
agriculture, he returned to his former occupation.&nbsp; <!--
page 169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>John Forster and William Carrington, respectable
merchants of Biggleswade, and neighbours to Riley Smith, procured
answers from him to all the queries in the Circular; but they
cannot be made the basis of any calculation of the number of
Gypsies in the nation.</p>
<p>It has not come to the knowledge of the writer, what
foundation there has been for the report commonly circulated,
that a Member of Parliament had stated to the House of Commons,
when speaking to some question relating to Ireland; that there
were not less than 36,000 Gypsies in Great Britain.</p>
<p>To make up such an aggregate, the numerous hordes must have
been included, who traverse most of the nation with carts and
asses, for the sale of earthenware, and live out of doors great
part of the year, after the manner of the Gypsies.&mdash;These
potters, as they are commonly called, acknowledge that Gypsies
have intermingled with them, and their habits are very
similar.&nbsp; They take their children along with them on
travel, and, like the Gypsies, regret that they are without
education.</p>
<p><!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>It has already appeared in Baillie Smith&rsquo;s
report, that the Gypsies in Scotland, of late years, have had
recourse to a similar occupation in the sale of earthenware,
which, as they mostly attend fairs, is a mode of life remarkably
adapted to their inclination.</p>
<p>Some pains have been taken among the potteries in
Staffordshire, to procure information of the number of families
of this description, which annually apply to purchase the refuse
of their wares; but no return has been made.</p>
<p>The application to the Sheriffs of Scotland, procured from the
counties prompt and decisive reports; and it is not probable that
any measure, short of an order to the constables of every
township, to take an account on the same day, throughout England,
would be sufficient for ascertaining Gypsey population.</p>
<p>For this purpose a patrole might be necessary, on one and the
same day, in each township, particularly in lanes and situations
shaded in summer.&nbsp; If notice of the requisition were to be
communicated to constables, a few days before, with directions
not to disclose the object, <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>further
than the necessary provision for it required; it is probable,
that a sufficiently correct estimate might be formed, of the
aggregate number in the nation.</p>
<p>Such an account might extend also to the itinerant potters,
and the number of their children: or if the potters take out a
Hawker&rsquo;s and Pedlar&rsquo;s licence, a return of their
numbers might be obtained from the proper office.&nbsp; There is
reason to think that many of these dealers have acquired
property, who, nevertheless take lodgings for the winter, instead
of renting houses; whereby they, equally with Gypsies, evade all
contributions to the service of the State, and parochial
assessments.</p>
<p>On this subject, the writer is reminded of what has often
occurred to him, when inspecting a low description of
lodging-houses in the populous town of Sheffield, of which he is
an inhabitant.&nbsp; Finding it difficult to obtain from the
keepers of such houses, sufficient information respecting their
guests; he has thought, that obliging all who lodge itinerants to
take out a licence, would, by rendering them amenable <!-- page
172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>to
just authority, obviate this difficulty; and put it in the power
of those respectable inhabitants, who wish the regulation of
these receptacles, to exercise just discrimination, without
infringing upon the liberty of the subject.&nbsp; He has reason
to believe, if this were effected, it would operate as a
considerable check on vagrancy, and save much trouble to
magistrates.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Present state of the Gypsies in and about
London.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the autumn of 1815, the author made a journey to London, in
order to obtain information respecting the Gypsies in its
vicinity.</p>
<p>The first account he received of the education of any of them,
was from Thomas Howard, proprietor of a glass and china shop, No.
50, Fetter-lane, Fleet-street.&nbsp; This person, who preached
among the Calvinists, said, that in the winter of 1811, he had
assisted in the establishment of a Sunday School in
Windmill-street, Acre-lane, near Clapham.&nbsp; It was under the
patronage of a single gentlewoman, of the name of Wilkinson, and
principally intended for the neglected and forlorn children of
brick-makers, and the most abject of the poor.&nbsp; It was begun
on a small scale, but increased till the number of scholars
amounted to forty.</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>During the winter, a family of Gypsies, of the name of
Cooper, obtained lodgings at a house opposite the school.&nbsp;
Trinity Cooper, a daughter of this Gypsey family, who was about
thirteen years of age, applied to be instructed at the school;
but, in consequence of the obloquy affixed to that description of
persons, she was repeatedly refused.&nbsp; She nevertheless
persevered in her importunity, till she obtained admission for
herself, and two of her brothers.</p>
<p>Thomas Howard says, that, surrounded as he was by ragged
children, without shoes and stockings, the first lesson he taught
them was silence and submission.&mdash;They acquired habits of
subordination, became tractable and docile; and, of all his
scholars, there were not any more attentive and affectionate than
these; and when the Gypsies broke up house in the spring, to make
their usual excursions, the children expressed much regret at
leaving the school.</p>
<p>This account was confirmed by Thomas Jackson, of Brixton-row,
minister of Stockwell Chapel, who said, since the above
experiment, several Gypsies had been admitted to a sabbath <!--
page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>school, under the direction of his congregation.&nbsp;
At their introduction, he compared them to birds when first put
into a cage, which flew against the sides of it, having no idea
of restraint; but by a steady even care over them, and the
influence of the example of other children, they soon became
settled, and fell into their ranks.</p>
<p>With a view to reconnoitre an encampment of Gypsies, the
author accepted a seat in the carriage of a friend, who drove him
to Hainault forest.&nbsp; This, according to historians, was of
vast extent in the times of the ancient Britons, reaching to the
Thames; and so late as the reign of Henry the 2d, it covered the
northern vicinity of the city.</p>
<p>On this forest, about two miles from the village of Chigwell,
Essex, and ten from London, stands the far-famed oak, at which is
held Fairlop Fair, that great annual resort of the Gypsies.</p>
<p>According to an account of it printed for Hogg,
Paternoster-row, the trunk or main stem of this tree has been
sixty-six feet, and <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>some of the branches twelve feet, in
circumference.&nbsp; The age of this prodigy of the forest cannot
be ascertained with any degree of precision.&nbsp; The oak viewed
by the present King, in Oxfordshire, and some years ago felled in
the domains of one of the Colleges, though only twenty-five feet
in girth, is said to have been six hundred years old.&nbsp;
Fairlop oak having been nearly thrice as large, is supposed to be
at least twice that age.</p>
<p>Phillips employed by the King, applied a patent mixture to
stop the progress of its decay, but, last autumn, when seen by
the describer, its naked gigantic trunk and arms, retaining not
the least symptom of animation, presented a ghastly spectacle of
the ravages of time, as contrasted with the rich verdure of the
surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>The circumstances which gave rise to the establishment of a
fair, on this spot of ground, are somewhat singular.</p>
<p>Daniel Day, an engine, pump, and block-maker, of Wapping,
having a small estate in the vicinity of this oak, was in the
habit of <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>annually resorting to it about a
fortnight after midsummer, to receive his rents, when he provided
a dinner under the tree, and invited several of his friends to
it.&nbsp; The novelty of the scene exciting the attention of the
neighbouring inhabitants, attendance on that occasion increased
until about the year 1725, when booths being erected round the
stupendous oak, the scene assumed the appearance of a regular
fair.&nbsp; It has continued to be held there, and it is said now
attracts a great number of attendants.</p>
<p>As this fair does not appear to be a mart for horses or
cattle, there is reason to fear, it is kept up more for revelry
and excess, than for any useful purpose.&nbsp; The ground has
been cleared to some extent about the oak, which stands at the
head of a circular lawn, surrounded by pailing, to protect it
from the ravages of the unthinking part of the multitude, who
assemble there.&nbsp; It is said to have been the practice of the
Gypsies, to kindle fires against the trunk, by which the bulk has
been diminished, and perhaps the vegetation injured.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>On the side of the forest, near to Dagenham, Essex, was
the encampment of Gypsies, of which the author&rsquo;s friend was
in quest.&nbsp; The construction of their tents, is well known to
be wooden hoops fastened into the ground, and covered with an
awning of blankets or canvas, which resembles the tilt of a
waggon; the end is closed from the wind by a curtain.&nbsp; This
gang was called by the name of Corrie.&nbsp; It consisted of an
old man, his wife, a niece, and their son and daughter with ten
children; said to be all from Staffordshire.&nbsp; The men were
scissars&rsquo; grinders and tinkers.</p>
<p>Questions being asked them respecting their condition, a young
woman made some observations upon them to an older woman, in
their own peculiar speech.&nbsp; This was the first time the
writer had an opportunity of ascertaining, what the language of
Gypsies in England really was.&nbsp; With the knowledge only of
Grellmann&rsquo;s vocabulary, he pointed out what the young woman
had expressed; upon which they immediately exclaimed, the
gentleman understands what we say; and they gave way to <!-- page
179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>immoderate transports of joy, saying, they would tell
him any thing he wished to know of them.</p>
<p>On being asked what gold was in their language, they replied
without hesitation, <i>sonnaka</i>, and immediately added, silver
was <i>roop</i>.</p>
<p>The opinion which has been entertained, that Gypsey language
was composed only of cant terms, or of what has been denominated
the slang of beggars, has probably been much promoted and
strengthened by the dictionary contained in a pamphlet entitled,
&ldquo;The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore
Carew.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists for the most part of English
words, vamped up apparently not so much for the purpose of
concealment, as burlesque.&nbsp; Even if used by this people at
all, the introduction of this cant, as the genuine language of
the community of Gypsies, is a gross imposition on the
public.</p>
<p>One of the women said, the education of their children was to
be desired, but their travelling from place to place was against
it.&mdash;A young man among them said, there were a <!-- page
180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>hundred of their people in Staffordshire.&nbsp; This
gang was intelligent as well as communicative, and gave proof of
more civility than is commonly attributed to Gypsies.</p>
<p>The author also visited Norwood, which was formerly a
principal rendezvous of the Gypsies.&nbsp; This village, near
Croydon, in Surry, is situated on a fine hill, and is a wildly
rural spot; but having been considerably inclosed of late years,
it is not now much frequented by the Gypsies.</p>
<p>John Westover, deputy of James Furnell, constable of Norwood,
stated, that about two months before, the Gypsies in that
neighbourhood had been apprehended as vagrants, and sent in three
coaches to prison.&nbsp; This account was confirmed by Edward
Morris, the landlord at the Gypsey house.&nbsp; It did not appear
that these Gypsies were committed for depredations on property,
but merely on the vagrant act.</p>
<p>Gypsies being <i>routed</i>, as it is termed, in this manner,
from various parts of the south, may probably have occasioned
their appearing in greater numbers in the northern parts of the
<!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>nation.&nbsp; The writer of this section being at
Scarborough, in the bathing season of 1815, had intelligence of
there being, at the same time, an encampment of Gypsies at
Boroughbridge, another at Knaresborough, and a third at
Pocklington, in the east-riding of Yorkshire.</p>
<p>On returning from Scarborough, he was told by an acquaintance
at Tadcaster, that a gang of about twenty Gypsies, were just gone
from the neighbourhood, after telling fortunes to most of the
people in the town.&nbsp; The same summer, a numerous horde had
been driven from the township of Rotherham; and there had been
two encampments in the neighbourhood of Sheffield.</p>
<p>The winter before the last, severe as it was, a gang of about
fifty or sixty, lay upon Bramley Moor, three miles from
Chesterfield.&nbsp; This information was received from Joseph
Storrs of Chesterfield, who has been an assiduous
coadjutor.&nbsp; From the same authority, the writer learns, that
a number of Gypsies usually came to Duckmanton, near
Chesterfield, at the feast, who appear to be in pretty good
reputation in <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>their transactions.&nbsp; Also that
there is a party of Gypsies who frequent Socombe-lane, near
Shirbrook, which is two miles east of Pleasley.&nbsp; They are
called Bosswell&rsquo;s gang, consisting of twelve, and sometimes
more, who mostly come once a year, and sometimes continue there
for most of it.&nbsp; A woman among them is about 90 years
old.&nbsp; They support a good character; and one of them who
bought a pony, had credit for it, and paid honestly on his
return.</p>
<p>After obtaining information at Norwood, of the winter-quarters
in London, to which Gypsies resorted; the author had an interview
with branches of several families of them, collected at the house
of his friend William Corder, Grocer, in Broad-street,
Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And in justice to them, he must observe,
that however considerably the fear of apprehension as vagrants,
may dispose them, when on travel and among strangers, to elude
their inquiries, no disposition to do so, appears in the company
of persons to whom they are known, and in whom they can repose
confidence.</p>
<p><!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>Being accustomed to lay out their money at the shop of
this grocer, he said they would be very ready to attend upon his
invitation; and accordingly, a number of them soon made their
appearance.&nbsp; They said there were about twenty of the name
of Lovell, who lodged in Bowles&rsquo;s yard, in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; These acknowledged themselves Gypsies, and
many of them had the features, as well as the complexion of
Asiatics.</p>
<p>Their account is, that they come into lodgings at Michaelmas,
and continue till April, then they set out on travel, and go into
Norfolk, &amp;c.</p>
<p>That some time ago, some of them had embraced an offer to
educate their children at St. Patrick&rsquo;s charity school,
which had been established by the chaplain to the Portuguese
ambassador; but some dissatisfaction arising in consequence of
the religion of the conductors of that Institution, they had
removed their children to the school for the Irish, taught by
Partak Ivery, No. 5, George-street.</p>
<p><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>Uriah Lovell, the head of one of the families, made a
very decent appearance; three of his children have been four
winters at school, and learned to read and write; their father
having paid sixpence per week, for each of them.&mdash;Partak was
sent for, and came to the house of William Corder, where he
confirmed the above account, saying there had been six Gypsey
children at his school, and that when placed among others, they
were reducible to order.</p>
<p>These Gypsies, like those upon Hainault forest, appeared to be
greatly delighted at meeting with a person, acquainted, as they
thought, with their language, and were remarkably free in
speaking it.</p>
<p>James Corder, son of William Corder, obtained the following
account of some of the lodgers in Westminster, and in the
Borough, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The older Gypsey children assist their parents in their
trades; a few of the younger go to school during winter.&nbsp;
Most of those who have children, are desirous of their receiving
an education; though but few have the means of procuring it.</p>
<p>They complain of the scarcity of work; and in some instances
appear to be distressed for want of it; the more so, as their

mendicity, there is only one example of a Gypsey girl begging in
the streets.</p>

excepting their attendance of fairs in the vicinity.&nbsp;
Others, when work is scarce, go out twenty or thirty miles round
the metropolis, carrying their implements with them on asses; and

hay-making, and plucking hops, in the counties of Kent, Surry,

<p>When it is known that Gypsies are unacquainted with letters,
and that James Corder, who took from the mouths of those in the
parish called St. Giles, the preceding Gypsey <!-- page 189--><a

not know of Grellmann&rsquo;s vocabulary, the coincidence appears
very remarkable; but it is still more so with the Turkish Gypsey
specimen by Jacob Bryant, exhibited also in the 8th
Section.&nbsp; Robert Forster of Tottenham, who has been a
coadjutor in this work, transmitted the following collection of
words obtained from Gypsies in his neighbourhood.</p>

<p>In the conversation a clergyman had with the Bosswell gang, as
published in the Christian Guardian for 1812 and 1813, they told
him <i>Chum</i>, was the sun; <i>Chuu</i>, the moon;
<i>Kalm&agrave;ro</i>, bread and butter; and <i>Livina</i>,
drink.&nbsp; The first two of those words almost exactly accord
with Grellmann&rsquo;s vocabulary, and the latter as nearly with
Robert Forster&rsquo;s and James <!-- page 190--><a

190</span>Corder&rsquo;s collection from Gypsies in and about
London.</p>
<p>From the comparative views which have been taken of Gypsey
expressions in various countries, there is reason to conclude
that wherever they have been scattered on the face of the earth,
they have spoken and transmitted the same language to their
descendants.&nbsp; That it should have been preserved by them,
when among people of other tongues, throughout centuries, for no
purpose that we are acquainted with, but that of concealment, is
indeed astonishing.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Sentiments of various persons on the moral
condition of the Gypsies</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After the extensive survey which has now been taken of the
customs and habits of this people, in the various countries they
inhabit, the reader will be prepared for the conclusions of
Grellmann, that Gypsies are indeed a singular phenomenon in
Europe.&nbsp; And remarkable it is, that the combined influence
of time, climate, and example, have not effected any material
alteration in their state.&nbsp; For the space of three or four
hundred years, they have gone wandering about as pilgrims and
strangers; they are found in eastern, as well as in western
countries; as well among the rude, as the civilized; among
indolent and active people; yet they remain in all places, as to
customs and habits, what their fathers were.</p>
<p><!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>It is asserted, there are two causes to which this
coincidence is to be attributed; one is the country where they
originate, with their consequent train of thinking; the other
arises out of the circumstances which have hitherto attended
their situation.&nbsp; Their peculiar notions and customs, leave
no doubt of their being of eastern origin.&nbsp; In oriental
countries, attachment to habit is so strong, that what has been
once current among them, be it ever so pernicious or ridiculous,
is persevered in; any affection which has once predominated,
retains its dominion for ages.</p>
<p>Mahomet knowing that the weak side of the Arabians was their
veneration for every thing handed down from their forefathers,
gave his new profession the colouring of antiquity, and affirmed
it to be the religion of Abraham.&nbsp; The Jesuits in China,
availed themselves of similar means, by referring to Confucius,
in aid of their doctrines, and thus they obtained admission for
their religion among the Chinese.&nbsp; In the eastern nations,
no change is adopted merely because it is an improvement.&nbsp;
The <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>Chinese are acquainted with the use
of glass, yet their mirrors are always made of metal; and their
windows of shells.&mdash;Mechanical watches have been for ages
used in the court of Pekin, but the bulk of the nation depend
upon the action of fire and water; the former, by the gradual
burning of a match composed of sweet smelling powder, the latter
by water, somewhat resembling our large hour-glasses.</p>
<p>If we consider the circumstances under which the Gypsies have
existed, we shall want nothing more to make us comprehend, why
they have remained to the present time, what they were at their
first arrival in Europe.&nbsp; Separating themselves as much as
possible from all association, but with those of their own tribe,
they avoid every means which might give a new turn to their
ideas, or in the least degree contribute to eradicate deep-rooted
prejudice.&mdash;Unused to reflect, and fettered by habit, they
arrived in our quarter of the globe; and it does not appear that
any measures have been enjoined for instructing or reforming
them, except <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>those of the Empress Theresa, which
were never put in execution.</p>
<p>The most extreme punishments failing to effect a change in the
habits of Gypsies, they were subjected in almost all countries to
banishment.&nbsp; They had been accustomed in their own country,
to live remote from cities and towns; now they became more
invariably inhabitants of forests, and penetrated deeper into
deserts; as, in consequence of the search which was made after
them, or, at least, threatened to be made, they judged themselves
more secure in seclusion and concealment, than they would have
been, in frequenting places of established abode, and having free
intercourse with the neighbouring, inhabitants.&nbsp; Thus they
became, in a greater degree, outcasts from civilized society; and
divested of the most, and perhaps the only, probable means, of
inducing a change in their manner.</p>
<p>Being always either persecuted, or left to themselves, no
other could be expected, than that they must ever remain in all
places the same.&nbsp; The character of people being formed by
the <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>instruction they receive in their
early years, can it be thought surprising, that Gypsies who are
idlers, should be also abandoned and thievish?&nbsp; Is it to be
expected that men should become diligent, who have been educated
in laziness?&nbsp; Who can have a general idea of fair dealing,
that has never been taught the distinction between good and evil,
virtue and vice?&nbsp; Perhaps it is reserved for <i>our age</i>,
in which so much has been attempted for the benefit of mankind,
to humanize a people, who, for centuries, have wandered in error
and neglect; and it may be hoped, that while we are endeavouring
to ameliorate the condition of our African brethren, the
civilization of Gypsies, who form so large a portion of humanity,
will not be overlooked.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied, that considering the multitude of them,
their reform must be a subject of very serious consideration to
many states.&nbsp; The period in which banishments were generally
pronounced on this people, were too unphilosophical for any
preferable mode of punishment to be suggested; but it may be <!--
page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>expected from a better informed age, that better maxims
will be adopted.&nbsp; We send apostles to the east and west, to
the most distant parts of the whole earth; and even into the very
country whence the Gypsies emigrated, to instruct the people who
know not God.&nbsp; Is it not inconsistent for men to be
solicitous for the welfare of their fellow-creatures in distant
regions, and to throw off, and leave to chance, those who,
equally wretched, have brought their errors home to us?&nbsp; If
it be a good work to teach religion and virtue to such as are
ignorant of their Creator, why not begin with those nearest to
us?&mdash;Especially as neglect in this particular, is attended
with detriment to the society of which we are members.</p>
<p>The Gypsies have been long enough among civilized people to
prove, that they will not be allured by the mere example of
others, to free themselves from the fetters of old customs and
vices.&nbsp; To accomplish that end, more effectual means are
requisite.</p>
<p>It would be vain to hope for any considerable progress in the
improvement of those who are <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>grown
up.&nbsp; Their reformation would be a difficult task, as the
attempts made by the Empress Theresa evinced:&mdash;you must
begin with children, and not meddle with the old stock, on whom
no efforts will have effect.</p>
<p>Expelling the Gypsies entirely, was not merely a premature
step, it was a wasteful one.&nbsp; This is indisputable, so long
as the state maxim holds good, that a numerous population is
advantageous.</p>
<p>Care being taken to enlighten their understandings, and amend
their hearts, they might become useful citizens; for observe them
at whatever employment you may, there always appear sparks of
genius.&nbsp; It is well known, and no writer omits to remark,
what artful devices they have recourse to, in perpetrating any
cheat or robbery: but this is not the only particular in which
they show capacity.&nbsp; The following extract is from a
Hungarian author, who was an attentive observer of these
people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Gypsies have a fertile imagination in
their way, and are quick and ready at expedients; so that in many
serious, doubtful cases, <!-- page 198--><a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>they soon
recollect how to act, in order to extricate themselves.&nbsp; We
cannot indeed help wondering, when we attend to, and consider the
skill they display in preparing and bringing their works to
perfection; which is the more necessary from the scarcity of
proper tools and apparatus.&nbsp; They are very acute and cunning
in cheating, or thieving; and when called to account for any
fraud or robbery, fruitful in invention, and persuasive in their
arguments to defend themselves.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>The recommendation of Grellmann, p. 197, to begin the
work of reform with children, appears judicious; but the events
of the present day justify the expectation, that benevolent
exertions would not prove fruitless, should they afterwards be
extended even to the &ldquo;<i>old stock</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the Circular introduced is the 10th Section was
distributed, the author did not know of the correspondence on the
subject of Gypsies, which had appeared in the interesting pages
of the Christian Observer.&nbsp; But he should now consider it an
injustice to those benevolent individuals, who had taken the lead
in this work of Christian charity, not to give full consideration
to the ideas they have suggested.</p>
<p>In Vol. VII. p. 91 of that periodical publication, is the
following letter.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>To the Editor of the
Christian Observer</i>.</p>
<p>As the divine spirit of Christianity deems no object, however
unworthy or insignificant, beneath <!-- page 200--><a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>her notice,
I venture to apply to you on behalf of a race, the outcasts of
society, of whose pitiable condition, among the many forms of
human misery which have engaged your efforts, I do not recollect
to have seen any notice in the pages of your excellent
miscellany.&nbsp; I allude to the deplorable state of the
Gypsies, on whose behalf I beg leave to solicit your good offices
with the public.&mdash;Lying at our very doors, they seem to have
a peculiar claim on our compassion.</p>
<p>In the midst of a highly refined state of society, they are
but little removed from savage life.&nbsp; In this happy country,
where the light of Christianity shines with its purest lustre,
they are still strangers to its cheering influence.&nbsp; I have
not heard even of any efforts which have been made, either by
individuals or societies, for their improvement; and so
thoroughly do they appear to despise the advantages of civilized
life, that perhaps nothing less than that change of heart, which
is the effect of the blessing of God on the means employed for
their conversion, would prevent their continuing <!-- page
201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to
be the pest of society.&nbsp; The great Shepherd of Israel
despises not these unhappy wanderers from his fold; and I am
persuaded, that neither you, nor those who read and prize your
work, will be insensible to the force of His benign example.</p>
<p>May the Divine Spirit suggest means, by which this wretched
race may be reclaimed from their vagrancy, and be made acquainted
with that Saviour, whom to know is life eternal!</p>

<p>It gave me pleasure to observe in one of the numbers of your
miscellany, a letter on a subject that has frequently engaged my
serious attention: I mean the state of the Gypsies.&nbsp; It is
painful to reflect how many thousands of these unhappy creatures,
have, since the light of Christianity has shone on this Island,
gone into eternity ignorant of the way of salvation, <!-- page
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>and without one cheering thought of a Saviour.&nbsp;
Surely, Sir, there is an awful responsibility attached to this
neglect!&nbsp; If we look back into the history of the Christian
church, from the earliest ages, we shall find that the
introduction of the gospel amongst any people, has generally been
effected by means of Missionaries; and so numerous are the
Gypsies, and so desultory in their habits of life, that it might
well occupy the time of more than one zealous individual, to go
amongst them, and by plain, simple, affectionate conversation and
exhortation, when practicable, instruct them in the knowledge of
their Redeemer.</p>
<p>Nor in this favoured land, where there are so many who
zealously embrace the doctrines of Christianity, would there, I
trust, be wanting both one, or more persons, who would devote
themselves to this truly apostolic work; and benevolent
individuals who would open their hearts and their purses, for the
support and encouragement of such an undertaking.&nbsp; This
labour of love would doubtless prove less arduous, than the
attempts which have been <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>made to
establish missions among the American Indians; the natives of the
South-Seas; or the inhabitants of Southern Africa.</p>
<p>The dread of the magistracy in this country, would prove a
protection from personal injury, while the painful relinquishment
of friends and country would not be required.&nbsp; I will also
beg leave to mention another suggestion: I have understood that,
in different parts of the kingdom, the neighbouring clergy meet
at stated times, for the purpose of conversing on the important
duties of their pastoral office.&nbsp; At such times, would it
not be well to take into consideration, the perishing condition
of so large a part of the community, as that, which forms the
subject of this letter?&nbsp; Some plan might probably be thus
devised, which, through the blessing of the Lord, would prove
effectual for the salvation of this out-cast, and hitherto
neglected people.</p>
<p>I would also take the liberty of recommending the cause of
these unhappy partners of our kind, to the humanity of our
dissenting brethren; and most earnestly solicit Christians <!--
page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>of all denominations, to unite in prayer to the God of
all grace, that he would prosper every attempt which may be made,
to communicate to them the knowledge of His will.&nbsp; I trust,
Sir, I shall obtain your excuse for detaining you on this
important subject; and as I know your pages are read and valued,
by real Christians of various denominations, perhaps they may,
through the Divine Providence, be the means of exciting effectual
attention, to the spiritual wants of this deplorable set of
beings; and the same benevolence which induced you to exert your
talents and influence in behalf of the oppressed negroes, may be
again successfully employed, in ameliorating the condition of a
numerous class of our fellow-creatures, who are second only to
them in wretchedness, and spiritual misery.</p>

<p>The insertion of the letter of &ldquo;Fraternicus,&rdquo; on

Fraternicus, the wretched state of this people, and hopes to see
the day when the nation which has, at length, done justice to the
poor negroes, will be equally zealous to do their duty in this
instance; and attempt to raise the Gypsies from their state of
degradation.&nbsp; If any way can be devised through the medium

spiritual and eternal condition of that ignorant and degraded
class of human beings, the Gypsies.</p>
<p>I wish much to see appropriate and active measures adopted,
immediately to put into execution the benevolent suggestions of
your worthy and sensible correspondents.&nbsp; I cannot do a
great deal in a pecuniary point of view, but in counsel and
influence I could do more.</p>
<p>I feel no hesitation in inviting your correspondents to a
meeting on the subject, with a view to the formation of some
plan, and the <!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>consequent commencement of active
exertions.&nbsp; One of the first objects to be aimed at, is the
introduction of cleanliness and decorum.&mdash;Another object to
be attended to, is, the teaching of them, especially the young,
to read; and then the supplying of them with testaments and
religious tracts.</p>
<p>There are many of the latter which would be both entertaining
and useful to them; but the most direct means to do them good is,
by frequent intercourse with them, and plain and familiar
conversation, prudently conducted.&nbsp; And if any thing be
done, it must be undertaken in a patient and persevering
spirit.</p>
<p>The soil which it is proposed to cultivate, is remarkably
barren and unpropitious; of course a plentiful harvest must not
be soon expected.&nbsp; The persons to be employed in this work
of faith and labour of love, must not only be men of prudence and
discretion, but men of information, and possessing clear and cool
heads, and warm hearts.</p>
<p>I have no doubt, but that in these times of active benevolence
and zeal, when a good plan <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>is laid,
and funds provided, instruments will be found, who with love in
their hearts, will go seek those wandering sheep in the
wilderness, for whom no man hath yet cared.</p>
<p>Many good hints, Mr. Editor, are often fruitless for want of
immediate attention; and many a good work long talked of is not
only suspended, but never begun, for want of some one to put
forth the hand and begin.&nbsp; I for one, say to your two
correspondents, &ldquo;let us arise and build; let us begin;
there is no fear of progress and help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was afraid the Gypsies had been quite forgotten; and
therefore it gives me real pleasure to see, by your last number,
for May 1809, that another correspondent has taken up their
cause.&nbsp; If the subject was once fairly before the public, I
am persuaded it would interest <!-- page 209--><a

feelings of many amongst us; and should good arise from it, which
with God&rsquo;s help and blessing, could not fail to be the
case, we might confidently look forward to a daily increasing
fund for its support.&nbsp; Surely when our charity is flowing in
so wide a channel, conveying the blessings of the gospel to the
most distant quarters of the globe, we shall not hesitate to
water this one barren and neglected field, in our own land.</p>
<p>My attention was first drawn to the state of this miserable
class of human beings, by the letter of
&ldquo;Fraternicus;&rdquo; and looking upon it as a reproach to
our country, that amidst the great light which prevails, so many
of its children should be walking in darkness and the shadow of
death, I was anxious to contribute something out of my abundance,
towards their spiritual welfare.&nbsp; I perfectly agree with
your correspondent, that no time should be lost in devising some
plan, which may give consistency and effect to this work of
faith, and labour of love.&nbsp; In this short and uncertain
life, no opportunities of usefulness should be <!-- page 210--><a

repeated.&nbsp; I am ready and desirous, to give Minimus the
proposed meeting; and the time and place might be appointed
through the medium of the Christian Observer.</p>
<p>I must however premise, that the writer of this is a very
humble individual in all respects, both in abilities, and in
influence.&nbsp; My habits are very retired, and at present, my
time is occupied in attending to the ministerial duties of a
populous village.&nbsp; I shall most gladly adhere to my first
proposal, and might be induced to do more, if need required.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it is my earnest prayer to God, that this may
not be one of those projects, which are only talked of, and never
begun; but that it may tend to the glory of his name, and to the
bringing back of those poor lost sheep to the fold of their
Redeemer.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p>As I am not in the constant habit of seeing your publication,
it is only lately, in meeting with your number for February last,
at the house of a friend, that I was aware that the spiritual
state of the Gypsies, had excited interest in the breasts of some
of your readers.</p>
<p>They are a race who have long excited interest in mine; so
much, that in the year 1801, I had written a letter upon the
subject to the society for bettering the condition, and
increasing the comforts of the poor; but I thought on further
reflection, that any attempts to civilize a race of beings so
degraded, and held in so much contempt, would be considered so
very visionary, that I gave up the idea and did not send
it.&nbsp; A greater lapse of time, farther observation, and the
suggestions of your correspondents, induce me to trouble you with
the few following remarks; recollecting that in literary attempts
and works of beneficence, it is the same as in pecuniary
subscriptions; that <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>great effects are not always
produced from the stores of an opulent individual, but from the
willing contributions of the many.</p>
<p>It does not appear to me, that a few, or even many
Missionaries, according to the suggestion of Fraternicus, Vol.
vii. p. 496, would answer the purpose of imparting religious
knowledge to the Gypsies; since on account of their wandering
mode of life, and from their not travelling in any numbers
together, it would be difficult to form congregations.&nbsp; What
the number of Gypsies, and of those who lead vagrant lives, like
them, may be in this kingdom, I cannot even form a conjecture;
and Mr. Colquhoun, I think does not mention them in his treatise
on the Police of the Metropolis.&nbsp; Neither am I acquainted
with their numbers and modes of life at Norwood, <a
name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a> which I understand is the chief
residence of them; what I have to say, therefore, is only from
observations made upon those who frequent this neighbourhood, and
from others seen occasionally when I have been travelling.</p>
<p><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>The suggestions of Minimus, Vol. viii. p. 286, appear
to me to be the most practicable: and I hope that there are many
Gypsies who would be inclined to profit by any judicious and kind
exertions made on their behalf.&nbsp; There are already several
families of them within my knowledge, who reside in houses during
the winter, and travel about only in the summer.&nbsp; Their
means of subsistence are tinkering, and fiddling at feasts and
fairs; by which some, I believe, make a good deal of money, which
helps them out in the winter, when there is less work and less
dancing.</p>
<p>A young man with a large family, whom I have long observed
near this place, in my walks, about six years ago, when many
inclosures took place in this neighbourhood, and he found it less
convenient to be out in the fields, or rather that the farmers
were less willing to let him encamp upon their grounds, took a
small house, with a garden annexed to it, in the suburbs of this
town, and has since lived here constantly in the winter, but
travels in the summer.&nbsp; He is now about 38 years of
age.&nbsp; <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span

children, all of whom have been baptized in the several parishes
where they were born.&nbsp; He is a very civil man, and is much
respected where he is known; having a good character for
honesty.</p>
<p>He attends church constantly on a Sunday; and though he has
not any regular notion of the peculiar doctrines of Christianity,
he has some very good general ideas of religion and
morality.&nbsp; He is no swearer; and he would consider it wicked
in his wife to attempt <i>to tell fortunes</i>.</p>
<p>He is frequently employed to fiddle, at the houses of
respectable farmers and trades-people at Christmas.&nbsp; His
other occupation is tinkering; and he is ingenious at mending
fiddles, and making cases, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Neither he, nor his wife, can read; and none of his children
have been hitherto sent to school.&nbsp; His third boy, who is
about 9 years old, he has, at my suggestion, promised to send to
the new school which has been established here on Dr.
Bell&rsquo;s and Mr. Lancaster&rsquo;s plan: he accepted the
offer with great thankfulness.&nbsp; The boy is to come into the
school at Michaelmas, <!-- page 215--><a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>when the family return from their
summer&rsquo;s travelling.&nbsp; The father would be very glad to
have all his children brought up to any other mode of life; and
even to embrace some other himself; but he finds a difficulty in
it.</p>
<p>He himself, from not having been brought up to work in
husbandry, could not go through the labour of it; and few, if any
persons, would be willing to employ his children, on account of
the bad character which his race bears; and from the censure and
ridicule which might attach to taking them, where they might be
willing to do it from motives of benevolence.</p>
<p>There is another family of Gypsies resident in this place in
the winter, the father of which was formerly a musician in the
guards.&nbsp; He has a boy now in the school.</p>
<p>These circumstances lead me to think, that were encouragement
given to them, the Gypsies would be inclined to live in towns and
villages like other people; and would in another generation or
two become civilized, and with the pains which are now taken to
educate the poor, and to diffuse the Scriptures and the <!-- page
216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>knowledge of Jesus Christ, would become a part of the
regular fold: while in the mean time, from personal intercourse
with their pastors, and from attending public worship, the
spiritual condition of the present generation would be materially
improved.&nbsp; It would, however, require much patient
continuance in well doing, in those who attempted it; and they
must be prepared, perhaps, to meet with some untowardness, and
much disappointment; but in due season we could not fail to reap,
if we fainted not.</p>
<p>All Gypsies must have some parish to which they belong; and if
these parishes were to provide habitations for them, and to hold
out encouragement to them to come and settle, and were to bear
for the present with any ways which might be different from those
of the regular inhabitants, affording them work as tinkers,
&amp;c. and providing education and work for their children; and
for the present, even bearing with their travelling in the
summer; this now almost unprofitable race of beings might be
reclaimed to society.&nbsp; Many of them <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>are
accustomed, in the seasons, to undertake hay and harvest
work.&nbsp; These, I think, with proper encouragement, might be
induced to get their living by husbandry work throughout the
year.</p>
<p>Should these suggestions lead to any farther discussion upon
the subject, or to adopting any measures to promote the desired
object; it would give me sincere pleasure to lend my assistance,
either pecuniary or personal.</p>

<p>The candid acknowledgment of your benevolent correspondent, in
the Christian Observer for February last, that his attention had
been first drawn to the state of the Gypsies by the <!-- page
218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

satisfaction to me; and as it is probable there may be no want of
inclination in the Christian world, to extend relief effectually
to them, permit me to solicit a place in your pages, for a
thought which has occurred to me in my meditations on the
subjects.</p>
<p>It appears from a letter in your number for May, that they are
not totally destitute of a desire for the benefit of
instruction.&nbsp; Information might easily be obtained, as to
what part of England they are to be found in the greatest
numbers; and if a free school could be instituted, and the means
of instruction provided for those of their children who were
willing to attend, at least in the winter season; might it not be
a means of conveying useful knowledge to them?</p>
<p>By degrees, they might be brought to attend divine worship
regularly; and if in the parish of a pious clergyman, he would
probably embrace the opportunity of teaching them, more
particularly, the way of salvation.&nbsp; Much, however, might be
done by a pious schoolmaster, and a <!-- page 219--><a

in different kinds of work, knitting, sewing, &amp;c.; and if any
of the parents should evince a desire for instruction, they could
be admitted at different hours in the day.&nbsp; It would be an
interesting inquiry, what becomes of orphans among them, and
whether there is not a possibility of at least rescuing them from
their present state of ignorance and misery.</p>
<p>Should these suggestions be deemed worthy of your insertion,
they might, perhaps awaken the attention of some benevolent
persons, whose superior talents and experience in the ways of
beneficence, would enable them to perfect and carry into
execution, a plan for the effectual benefit of those unhappy

<p class="gutsumm">Review of the Subject, and Suggestions for
ameliorating the condition of the Gypsies in the British
Empire.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Since the commencement of the present year, 1816, a friend <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a> of the author has informed him, that
about three weeks before, he was in company with an English and a
Persian gentleman, who had lately come from Persia, through
Russia; the latter well understood the languages of both
countries, and spoke them fluently.&nbsp; He had travelled with
the Persian Ambassador; and said that he had met with many hordes
of Gypsies in Persia; had many times conversed with them; and was
surprised to find their language was the true Hindostanie.&nbsp;
He did not then know of Grellmann&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; He further
stated, that the Gypsies in Russia were, in language and manners,
the <!-- page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 222</span>same, and exactly corresponded with
the Gypsies of this country.&nbsp; Their name in Persia signified
<i>Black Eyes</i>.</p>
<p>From whatever part of the world we derive intelligence of this
people, it tends to corroborate the opinion, that they have all
had one peculiar origin.&nbsp; How little has it occupied the
contemplation of Britons, that there existed among them, subjects
of such great curiosity as the poor and despised Gypsies!</p>
<p>The statute of Henry VIII. imposing a fine of forty pounds
upon the importation of a Gypsey, induces the belief they were
much in request in England at that period.&nbsp; The attention
which their low performances attracted in those times, will not
perhaps excite surprise, when we see the encouragement given in
our day, to their idly disposed countrymen, termed, <i>Indian
Jugglers</i>.&nbsp; It is remarkable, that the earliest account
of Gypsies in Great Britain, is in a work published to expose and
detect the &ldquo;Art of Juggling,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>The first of this people who came into Europe, must have been
persons of discernment and discrimination, to have adapted their
deceptions <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>so exactly to the genius and habits
of the different people they visited, as to ensure success in all
countries.</p>
<p>The stratagem to which they had recourse on entering France,
evinces consummate artifice of plan, and not a little adroitness
and dexterity in the execution.&nbsp; The specious appearance of
submission to papal authority, in the penance of wandering seven
years without lying in a bed, combined three distinct
objects.&nbsp; They could not have devised an expedient more
likely to recommend them to the favor of Ecclesiastics; or better
concerted for taking advantage of the superstitious credulity of
the people, and, at the same time, for securing to themselves the
gratification of their own nomadic propensities.&nbsp; So
complete was the deception they practised, that we find they
wandered up and down in France, under the eye of magistracy, not
for seven only, but for more than a hundred years, without
molestation.</p>
<p>In 1561, the edict of the States of Orleans directed their
expulsion by fire and sword; yet in 1612, they had increased to
such a degree, <!-- page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>that there was another order for
their total extermination.&nbsp; Notwithstanding this severity,
in 1671 they were again spread over the kingdom, as appears in
the letters of the Marchioness de S&eacute;vign&eacute; to her
friends, and the Countess Grignan, in nine volumes, translated
from the last Paris edition: &ldquo;Bohemians travel up and down
the Provinces of France, and get their living by dancing, showing
postures, and telling fortunes; but chiefly by pilfering,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is remarkable, that in all countries, they professed to be
Egyptians; but the representation is not only refuted by
Bellonius, but by later writers, who assert, that the &ldquo;few
who are to be found in <i>Egypt</i>, wander about as strangers
<i>there</i>, and form a distinct people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As historians admit that the greatest numbers of them are to
be found in Turkey, and south of Constantinople, there is reason
to apprehend they had a passage through that country.&nbsp; If
many of them did not visit Egypt previously to their arrival in
Europe, they probably wished to avail themselves of the
reputation <!-- page 225--><a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>the Egyptians had acquired in occult
sciences, that they might practise with greater success, the arts
to which they had been previously accustomed, and the practice of
which is common in various parts of Asia.&nbsp; In other respects
the habits of Egypt were very dissimilar to theirs.</p>
<p>We find by the reports on the first question put by the
Circular, mentioned in Section IX. that &ldquo;all Gypsies in
this country suppose the first of them came from Egypt;&rdquo;
and this idea is confirmed by many circumstances that have been
brought into view in the course of this work.&nbsp; In addition
it may be observed, that before the discovery of the passage to
India, by the Cape of Good Hope, all the productions of the east,
that were distributed in Europe, came to Egyptian ports.&nbsp;
Hence we have many concurring testimonies, which render it highly
probable, if not evidently clear, that the first Gypsey tribes
who came into England, and other parts of Europe, migrated from
hordes of that people who had previously found their way into
Egypt.</p>
<p><!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>The evidence appears equally strong, that they were not
natives of Egypt; but as the Egyptians were in great repute for
the practice of the occult sciences, common to them and to the
Suder caste; we cannot be surprized to find these crafty
itinerants, should avail themselves of such an opportunity, as
coming out of that country, to profess themselves Egyptians.</p>
<p>Continental writers exhibit a strange assemblage of crude, and
incongruous ideas on the subject of Gypsey extraction.&nbsp; So
numerous are the opinions diffusely stated, that Grellmann must
have exercised much patient investigation, to deduce from them
the rational and satisfactory conclusions which his Dissertation
presents.</p>
<p>Our countryman Swinborne, in describing the Gypsies in
Calabria, is the first to remark that their peculiar language
bears great affinity to the oriental tongues; and that many of
their customs resemble those of the heathens.&nbsp; But European
ignorance of the habits and speech of Asiatics may be accounted
for, whilst the rich <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>productions of India continued to be
brought to Egyptian ports, and to be conveyed thence by the
Lombard merchants, to be distributed over Europe</p>
<p>The <i>Cingari</i>, <i>Zigeuners</i>, or <i>Gypsies</i>, had
been in Germany nearly a century, before the Portuguese
discovered the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope.&nbsp;
The stimulus which this discovery gave to improvements in the art
of navigation, soon opened immediate intercourse with the eastern
world.&nbsp; Vast are the establishments, which have been
subsequently effected, in that quarter of the globe by naval
powers, and extraordinary have been, of late years, the exertions
for the acquisition of oriental languages; yet so numerous are
they in those widely extended regions, that European knowledge of
Asiatic etymology, is yet but in a state of infancy.</p>
<p>The case of the Gypsies is singular; for it may fairly be
questioned, whether it has a parallel in the history of the
world.&nbsp; Dispersed over the face of the earth, without any
organization of their different hordes; and all <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>concert between them entirely precluded by separations
of hundreds of miles from each other, in different parts of the
globe, and by their incapacity for literary communication; they
have, however, whilst speaking the languages of the respective
countries they inhabit, preserved in <i>all places one</i>
peculiar to themselves, and have transmitted it through a lapse
of centuries to their descendants, almost unimpaired.</p>
<p>Increased acquaintance with oriental customs and tongues, has,
at length, discovered the near coincidence they have with the
language of the Gypsies, and has developed an origin of this
people, of which those of the present age were, till now,
entirely ignorant.&nbsp; It will appear extraordinary, that these
people should have been able, by oral means alone, and under all
disadvantages, to retain their language, and yet not to have
handed down with it, any tradition that might lead to a discovery
of who they were, or whence they came.&nbsp; But the knowledge
recently acquired, of their very abject condition in the country
from which they <!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>emigrated, offers a reason why the
first comers might be anxious to conceal their pedigree, the
meanness of which would have but ill accorded with the titles of
rank assumed by some of their leaders.</p>
<p>The regulations proposed by the Empress Theresa, and the
Emperor Joseph II. could they have been carried into effect,
would doubtless have improved the state of the Gypsies.&nbsp; But
an order for children to be torn away from their parents, was so
far from being dictated by the study of human nature, that it did
violence to the tenderest sensibilities, and set at nought the
kindest emotions.&nbsp; Its tendency was to produce in the minds
of Gypsies, disaffection to the state, and to indispose others
from aiding in the execution of the edict.&nbsp; The advantages
to be derived by Governments from a liberal toleration, being not
then so well understood as in succeeding times, they were not
duly regarded.</p>
<p>Those potentates considering Zigeuners of Egyptian origin,
might reasonably conceive agriculture well adapted to their
genius and <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>inclination; but it was a pursuit,
which, more than any other, they disapproved.</p>
<p>All other Governments appear to have been misled, in like
manner, by the deception which the first Gypsies practised; for
had they been apprized of this people&rsquo;s descent, and of the
almost unalterable pertinacity of an Indian caste, they would
have been sensible that an attempt to change their habits by
force, was a measure the least likely to be attended with
success.</p>
<p>The Circular introduced in the ninth Section of this work,
notices Gypsies being hunted like beasts of prey, from township
to township in England; and it has been ascertained, that in some
places they are routed, as it is termed, by order of magistrates,
whenever they appear, and sent to prison on the vagrant act,
without so much as a charge of depredation upon property.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is to make their persons, an object of persecution,
instead of the protection of our laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the credit of our country it may be hoped, that instances
of this sort, respecting <!-- page 231--><a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>Gypsies,
are not very numerous; seeing all writers concur in stating,
every attempt by coercive means to alter the peculiar habits of
this people, have had a tendency to alienate them still more from
civil associations, and directly to defeat the end
proposed.&nbsp; It is time therefore that a better and a more
enlightened policy should be adopted in Europe, towards a race of
human beings, under so many hereditary disadvantages as are the
helpless, the rude, the uninstructed Gypsies.</p>
<p>In the decision on the vagrant case, in Crabbe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hall of Justice,&rdquo; <a name="citation231a"></a><a
href="#footnote231a" class="citation">[231a]</a> and in the
treatment of Gypsies on Knoland-Green, <a
name="citation231b"></a><a href="#footnote231b"
class="citation">[231b]</a> a temper is displayed so truly
Christian, and so different from what is just alluded to, that in
consulting the best feelings of human nature, it adds dignity to
magistracy.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Morton Eden, in his first volume on the State of
the Poor, p. 306, refers to an Act passed in 1741, respecting
that class of the poor, who are considered by the Legislature
<!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>as the outcasts of society, namely rogues, vagabonds,
&amp;c.; and he remarks: &ldquo;From perusing the catalogue of
actions which denominate a man, a disorderly person, a vagabond,
or incorrigible rogue, the reader may perhaps incline to think
that many of the offences specified in this Act, and in
subsequent statutes, on the same subject, are of a very dubious
nature, and that it must require nice legal acumen, to
distinguish whether a person incurs any, and what, penalty, under
the vagrant laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In support of this opinion, and of the indefinite and
unjustifiable latitude of those statutes, a late decision at
Maidstone, in the action of Robins, v. Boyce, affords a striking
demonstration.</p>
<p>If the statutes do not admit of any construction in favor of
Gypsies, but enjoin rigorous treatment of them, merely for
wandering, it may become a question whether the peculiar
circumstances of their case, might not constitute an exception to
the general rule.</p>
<p><!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>However wholesome and salutary vagrant Acts may be, to
deter persons from quitting their parishes in order to levy
contributions, by practising impositions in places where they are
not known, it is obvious that Gypsies, having no parochial
settlements, cannot come under that description.&nbsp; Excepting
a temporary residence of some of them in winter, their home is a
whole county, and the majority of them are too independent to
apply to any parish for assistance.</p>
<p>Here is a trait in their character, which, were it grafted on
the stock of half the paupers in the kingdom, would be a national
advantage.</p>
<p>It ought to procure some indulgence for the Gypsies, that
their wandering mode of life does not originate in any
contumacious opposition to judicial order; but in a scrupulous
regard to the Institutions of their ancestors.&nbsp; For the
advantages we possess, shall we return injury to our
fellow-men!&nbsp; If after being fully introduced into a
situation to taste the comforts of social order, and to acquire a
knowledge of mechanical professions, which would render <!-- page
234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>them useful and respectable, any of them, despising
these privileges, should indulge wandering dispositions, they
might then deserve all the punishment which under the vagrant
Acts, can be indicted.</p>
<p>It is worthy of remark, that in the evidence respecting
mendicity in London, adduced last year before the Committee of
the House of Commons, there is only a single instance in the
parish called St. Giles, that noted rendezvous of Gypsies, of one
of their tribe, a girl, begging in the streets.</p>
<p>Is it not high time the people of England were undeceived,
respecting the motives to Gypsey perseverance in their singular
line of conduct.&nbsp; Their invincible attachment to the
traditions they have received, is almost proof, in itself, of
Grellmann&rsquo;s assertion, that they are the descendants of an
Indian caste; in whose estimation inviolable adherence to the
customs of their order, constitutes the highest perfection of
character.</p>
<p>When any remark is made to them on their strange mode of
conduct, they are ready to <!-- page 235--><a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>reply:
&ldquo;The inhabitants of cieled houses follow the customs of
their predecessors; What more do we?&nbsp; Are they creatures of
habit?&nbsp; So are we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this account, is it surprising that the violent means
pursued against them in all countries, have been ineffectual to
abolish their peculiarities?</p>
<p>Their humane and intelligent biographer, Grellmann, styles
them a &ldquo;singular phenomenon in Europe;&rdquo; and it may
justly be observed of such of them as inhabit countries accounted
the most enlightened, that the contrast which their destitute
state presents to the numerous advantages of civilized life, and
to the refinements of polished society, is truly
astonishing.&nbsp; If there possibly can be a single Briton who
is a skeptic to the benefits of education, let him only take a
view of the intellectual degradation and disgusting condition of
the Gypsies.&nbsp; But if Britons have made greater advancement
in civilization than some other nations, the Gypsies here are
left at a greater <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>distance, and furnish the more
occasion for their condition being improved.</p>
<p>It does not appear that the Pariars, or Suders, from whom it
is believed these swarthy itinerants of our age are descended,
were farther advanced in the knowledge of moral obligations, than
were the Spartan people; who, however celebrated for some of
their Institutions, accounted the successful perpetration of
thefts to be honourable.</p>
<p>The Gypsies at Kirk Yetholm, as stated by Baillie Smith, in
this part of their conduct, are an exact counterpart of the
Spartans.&nbsp; To a people of Greece, the foremost of their time
in legislative arrangements, who had cultivated so little sense
of the turpitude of injustice, surely a much more criminal
neglect may be imputed, than to the ignorant, untutored race we
have been surveying!</p>
<p>Malcolm, in his Anecdotes of the manners and customs of
London, p. 350, says of the English Gypsies: &ldquo;Despised, and
neglected, they naturally became plunderers and thieves to obtain
a subsistence.&rdquo;&nbsp; But when he afterward <!-- page
237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>states, that &ldquo;They increased rapidly, and at
length were found in all parts of the country,&rdquo; we may be
disposed to think that British fastidiousness was not less
ingenious than that of the Spaniards, who considered themselves
<i>contaminated</i> by a touch of the Gypsies, unless it were to
have their fortunes told.&nbsp; Venality and deception meeting
with so much encouragement, those propensities of the human heart
would be generated and fostered, which at length produced
flagrant impositions, and the greatest enormities.</p>
<p>The dominion of superstition was at its zenith, in what are
termed the middle ages: so absolute and uncontrolled was its
influence, that because of reputed skill in exorcism and
witchcraft, the deluded Germans reposed implicit confidence in
persons so ignorant as the Gypsies.</p>
<p>What an impeachment of British sagacity, is the following
observation of Sir Frederick Morton Eden, in his first volume on
the State of the Poor, p. 146: &ldquo;It is mortifying to
reflect, that whilst so many wise measures were adopted by the
great Council of the Nation, <!-- page 238--><a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>neither a
Coke, nor a Bacon, should oppose the law suggested by royal
superstition, for making it felony to <i>consult</i>, <i>covenant
with</i>, <i>entertain</i>, <i>employ</i>, <i>feed</i>, <i>or
reward</i>, <i>any evil</i>, <i>or wicked spirit</i>, 2d James,
12th.&mdash;It is still more mortifying to reflect, that the
enlightened Sir M. Hale left a man for execution, who was
convicted on this Act, at Bury, March 10th, 1664; and that even
in the present (the 18th) century, a British Jury should be
persuaded that the crime of witchcraft could exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the annual filling of prisons in England may be attributed,
in any degree, to the neglect of educating the lower orders of
the people, it will appear extraordinary, that instances of
Gypsies being convicted of capital crimes, are not more frequent,
rather than that they sometimes occur.</p>
<p>The Committee of the British and Foreign School Society, in
their Report for 1815, express their conviction of the advantages
of education, in correcting evils, which at once disgrace
society, and deprive it of many, who might be its most useful and
active members; <!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>and then, they exclaim:
&ldquo;Surely we may hope the day is not far distant, when
Statesmen and Legislators of all countries, will open their eyes
to the awfully important truth; and beholding in a sound and
moral education, the grand secret of national strength, will
co-operate for the <i>prevention</i>, rather than the
<i>punishment</i> of crimes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until near the conclusion of the last year, and
after the author had inspected some of the Gypsey families who
winter in London, that he was apprized of the correspondence in
the Christian Observer, which forms part of the preceding
Section.&nbsp; The position with which it commences, is worthy of
all acceptation, as applied to beings formed for immortality:
&ldquo;The Divine Spirit of Christianity deems no object, however
unworthy and insignificant, beneath her notice.&nbsp; Gypsies
lying at our doors, seem to have a peculiar claim on our
compassion.&nbsp; In the midst of a highly refined state of
society, they are but little removed from savage life.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>The letters extracted from the Christian Observer, are
distinguished by a Christian zeal and liberality, which must be
cheering to every one, who has felt an interest in improving the
condition of these greatly neglected partners of his kind.&nbsp;
On their behalf, appeals to the public have been subsequently
made, as we have seen in Section IX, through the medium of the
Northampton Mercury of 1814, by two correspondents; one under the
designation of &ldquo;A Friend to Religion;&rdquo; the other,
that of &ldquo;Junius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Communications from a county which has long been a noted
rendezvous of Gypsies, may be considered the result of
observations actually made on their state.&nbsp; The first of
these appeals is introduced in the following manner:
&ldquo;Various are the religious and moral Institutions in this
country; humanity and benevolence have risen to an unprecedented
height.&nbsp; Not only for our country, are the exertions of the
good and great employed, but at this time the greatest efforts
are making on behalf of the distressed Germans.&nbsp; The hand of
charity is <!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>open not only to the alleviation of
<i>present</i> misery, but such an Institution as the Bible
Society, is calculated to excite thousands to seek for
<i>future</i> happiness.&nbsp; Yet amidst all, one set of people
seems to be entirely excluded from participating in any of those
blessings; I mean Gypsies, who are accounted rogues and
vagabonds.&nbsp; When we consider that they, equally with
ourselves, are bought with a price, much remains to be done for
them.&nbsp; These people, however wretched and depraved,
certainly demand attention; their being overlooked with
indifference, is really much to be regretted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead of being subjects of commiseration, they are
advertised as rogues and vagabonds; and a reward offered for
their apprehension.&nbsp; But no asylum is offered them, nothing
is held out to encourage a reformation in any that might be
disposed to abandon their accustomed vices.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same
writer, in a subsequent letter, dated September 8, respecting
these houseless wanderers, remarks: &ldquo;I was representing the
deplorable state they are in, to a person of my acquaintance; and
his reply was: <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>They were a set of worthless and
undeserving wretches; and he believed they would rather live as
they do, than otherwise; with many other such like inconsiderate
ideas; resulting, I believe, from a prejudiced mind, and from not
properly considering their situation; and I fear these sentiments
are too prevalent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will readily be admitted, that they are generally
prevalent: and how should it be otherwise, so long as the great
mass of the population of England continues to be uninformed of
the motives inducing the strange conduct of Gypsies, who consider
themselves under the strongest of all obligations, strictly to
observe the Institution of their ancestors.&nbsp; Had Britons
been apprized of the origin of this people, and the peculiar
circumstances of their case, the national character would not
have been stained, by the abuse and mal-treatment which Gypsies
have received.</p>
<p>It is very satisfactory to find by the before recited
correspondence, an inhabitant of the county in which the Gypsies
are so numerous, advocating their cause, by a public exposure of
<!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>the mistaken ideas which have so long prevailed
respecting them.</p>
<p>From the length of time they have continued to reside in
Britain, they have ceased to become subjects of much curiosity or
conversation.&nbsp; And as they endeavour to avoid populous
districts, persons in large towns, who are occupied in trade,
seem little aware that in the county they inhabit, there may be
hordes of these wanderers, traversing the thinly inhabited parts
of it, in various directions, as was the case in Yorkshire during
the last summer. (1815.)</p>
<p>When the amelioration of the condition of this people is
mentioned to persons of the above description, so little informed
are they on the subject, that it is many times treated as if the
existence of Gypsies was questioned; at others, as if affording
any help to them, was visionary, and even ludicrous.</p>
<p>Some places formerly frequented by Gypsey gangs, having been
much deserted by them of late years, does not authorize any
calculation upon a decrease of their numbers in the nation.</p>
<p><!-- page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>In the vicinity of the metropolis, Gypsies have been
excluded by inclosures from various situations to which they had
been accustomed to resort.&nbsp; But there is some reason to
apprehend they have become more numerous, in several other parts
of the Island.&nbsp; Baillie Smith of Kelso, is of opinion, they
increase in Scotland, and it is by no means certain that they do
not in England.</p>
<p>Any idea that routing them will lessen their numbers, may be
as fallacious, and injudicious, as were banishments from the
German States, which, without diminishing Gypsey population, had
the injurious effect of alienating them still more from civil
associations.</p>
<p>Junius, the other correspondent of the Northampton Mercury, in
his Address of October 29, writes: &ldquo;I trust the time is not
distant, when much will be accomplished, as it respects the
civilization of the people whose cause we plead.&nbsp; In the
meantime, I would humbly hope all those harsh and degrading
measures, of publicly in the papers, and upon placards by the
sides of roads, ordering their apprehension and <!-- page
245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>commitment to prison, will be suspended, until some
asylum is offered; and should nothing be attempted by the
Legislature, for reclaiming them from their present mode of life,
surely much may be done by the exertions of
individuals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the observations in the Christian Observer, and in the
Northampton Mercury, are striking and pertinent, as they relate
to the present state of the Gypsies in England; and the
philanthropy they inculcate is honourable to the national
character.&nbsp; Had these benevolent individuals been acquainted
with the history of the people, whose cause they plead, they
would, doubtless, have suggested plans adapted to their peculiar
case.&nbsp; For want of this knowledge, it is not surprising that
occupations in husbandry should take the lead in propositions for
employing them.&nbsp; The last mentioned writer, from a desire to
render essential service to this people, suggests, that the
Legislature should fix upon five or six stations in different
parts of the kingdom, on which <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>villages
should be erected, in order that they might be employed in
farming.</p>
<p>It will have been obvious in the survey which has been taken,
and it has been already remarked, that of all occupations,
agriculture is the least adapted to their genius and
inclination.</p>
<p>It has appeared in Section IX, that Riley Smith, a chief of
the Northamptonshire Gypsies, after marrying the cook out of a
gentleman&rsquo;s family, and obtaining a farm, quitted it, to
resume musical performances.</p>
<p>Conformity to agricultural employments, could not be effected
in Gypsies, by the most rigorous measures to which the Empress
Theresa, and the Emperor Joseph II. resorted.&mdash;Much less
could it be expected that persons, who, all their lives, have
accustomed themselves to be in the open air, or others who have
lived three parts of the year in this manner, should be induced,
in open weather, to brook the restraint of houses.</p>
<p>Those who have houses at Kirk Yetholm, quit them in spring:
men, women, and children, <!-- page 247--><a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>set out on
their peregrinations over the country, and live in a state of
vagrancy, until driven back to their habitations by the approach
of winter; and it appears, in all countries to which the Gypsies
have had access, that a similar course is pursued by them.</p>
<p>In a dialogue between a Curate and some Gypsies, as published
in the Christian Guardian, of March, 1812, is the following
question and answer:</p>
<p><i>Curate</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could you not by degrees bring
yourselves to a more settled mode of life?</p>
<p><i>Gypsey</i>.&nbsp; I would not tell you a story, Sir; I
really think I could not, having been brought up to it from a
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this conversation, the Curate makes the following remark:
&ldquo;In order to do good among the Gypsies, we must conciliate
their esteem, and gain their confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plain and simple reply to the Curate, will put out of
question the erection of villages, or the making of
establishments for adults among them.&nbsp; In mechanical
operations, to which the Gypsies are most inclined, British <!--
page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>artisans might be as averse to unite with them, as they
were with the Jews.&nbsp; The Spaniards, it has appeared, are
unwilling to be associated with Gypsies in any kind of
occupation.&nbsp; Moreover, the competition of manufacturers in
England, during the last fifty years, has effected by artificial
means, so much saving of manual labour, and so much improvement
in the division of it, that the rude operations of Gypsies, would
be a subject of ridicule and contempt.</p>
<p>J. P., in a letter from Cambridge to the Christian Observer,
very feelingly states the case of a Gypsey family, the father of
which, being a travelling tinker and fiddler, intimated, he would
be glad to have all his children brought up to some other mode of
life, and even to embrace some other himself; but he finds a
difficulty in it.&nbsp; Not having been brought up in husbandry,
he could not go through the labour of it; and few, if any
persons, would be willing to employ <a name="citation248"></a><a
href="#footnote248" class="citation">[248]</a> his children, on
account of <!-- page 249--><a name="page249"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 249</span>the bad character which his race
bears, and from the censure and ridicule which would attach to
the taking of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There appears so little probability of any useful change being
effected in the nomadic habits of adult Gypsies, that it seems
better to bear with that propensity for some time longer, than by
directly counteracting it, so disturb the minds of parents, as to
indispose them to consent to the education of their
children.&nbsp; There are thousands of other people in the
nation, who, more than half their time, live out of doors in like
manner.&nbsp; Were they all obliged to take out licences, this
measure might operate in some degree as a check upon them; at
least it would be a tacit acknowledgment of a controlling power,
and might admit of some regulation of their conduct.&nbsp; At
present, numbers of them resemble a lawless banditti, and may not
inaptly be termed, <i>Imperium in imperio</i>.</p>
<p>It appears by J. P.&rsquo;s letter from Cambridge, that six
years ago, he had engaged a Gypsey boy to be sent to a school on
the Belleian and <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Lancasterian plan.&nbsp; At that
time, the system had been but little appropriated in the country
to the instruction of girls; and the application of it to boys
only, would have been doing the work by halves.&nbsp; But the
time seems now to have arrived, when the minds of Gypsies have
generally received an impression in favor of the education, both
of their sons and daughters, as has been manifest in various
parts of this Survey; and that some of those who lodge in London,
have been themselves at the expense of sending their children to
school.&nbsp; But if all of them could be thus taught, three
months in a year, would not their running wild the other nine,
under the influence of dissolute and unrestrained example, be
likely to defeat every purpose of instruction.</p>
<p>Were they to be educated during the whole of the year, it is
obvious that some establishment would be necessary for their
maintenance and clothing.&nbsp; The author of this Survey is not
aware of any Institutions so much adapted to their case, as the
charity schools for boys and girls, which are common to every
part of the <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>kingdom.&nbsp; It is not probable
that Gypsey population would furnish more than two boys, and two
girls, for each of these schools.&nbsp; Their being placed among
a much greater number of children, and those of settled, and in
some degree of civilized habits, would greatly facilitate the
training of Gypsies to salutary discipline and subordination; and
the associations it provided for them out of school hours, being
under the superintendence of a regular family, would, in an
especial manner, be favorable to their domestication.</p>
<p>Charity schools, by admitting children so early as at six
years of age, and continuing them to fourteen, seem particularly
suited to the case of Gypsies, in supplying all that is requisite
until the boys are at an age to go out apprentices, and the girls
to service in families.</p>
<p>Gypsies being the children of a whole county, if not of the
nation at large, perhaps the expense of their maintenance might,
without inconsistency, be defrayed out of county rates, which
would prevent its being burdensome to any particular
district.&nbsp; By a process so simple <!-- page 252--><a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>and easy,
expensive establishments on the account of Gypsies, might be
entirely avoided.&nbsp; And many parents among them, express a
willingness to part with their children, for education, provided
they were cared for in other respects.</p>
<p>After several centuries, a degree of solicitude being at
length apparent in the Gypsies, for the improvement of their
children, the time has arrived when some effectual benefit may be
communicated to them.</p>
<p>The distribution proposed, would admit of these itinerants
seeing their children once in the year.&nbsp; But to extirpate
Gypsey habits, education alone would not be sufficient.&nbsp; Yet
as there is no reason to think this people are less susceptible
than others, of gainful considerations, a fund might be provided,
out of which, twenty pounds should be paid with each boy, on his
apprenticeship to some handicraft business, in lieu of finding
him with clothes during the term.&nbsp; And in consideration of
its being faithfully served, five pounds might be allowed to find
the young man with tools for his trade, <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>or
otherwise setting him forward in the world.&nbsp; This would
excite an interest in civil associations and order, which are
necessary for the successful prosecution of trade; and probably,
an encouragement like this, would have a greater effect in giving
a new direction to Gypsey pursuits, than any coercive or
restrictive measures which could be devised.&nbsp; And who would
not wish to contribute to the means of rescuing from ignorance
and vice, such a portion of the population of their
country!&nbsp; Who would not be desirous of emulating in some
degree, that best kind of patriotism, by which the correspondent
H. of the Christian Observer, is so remarkably distinguished!</p>
<p>This would be an example worthy of a great nation; and is it
not probable, that the prospect of so much preferment, would
induce Gypsey parents, to promote to the utmost of their power, a
disposition in their children to obtain it?&nbsp; Cooper, a
Gypsey at Chingford Green, said, &ldquo;It is a pity they should
be as ignorant as their fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This may be
considered as the language of &ldquo;<i>help us</i>,&rdquo;
accompanied with this acknowledgment, <!-- page 254--><a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&ldquo;<i>for we are unable to help
ourselves</i>;&rdquo; and certainly there is but too much reason
to conclude it is strictly true, respecting the instruction of
this forlorn and destitute race.</p>
<p>According to the enumeration of Gypsey lodgers, given in
Section X, their families average 5&frac12; in number.&nbsp; This
exceeds by one half, what is reported to be the average of
England in general.&nbsp; If we take Gypsey population at 18,000,
their children will be 12,000.&nbsp; Supposing two-thirds of
these to be under twelve years of age, there would be 8,000 to
educate.&nbsp; Reckoning half that number to be girls, 4,000 boys
would be to be apprenticed after leaving school.&nbsp; And if
these, after their apprenticeship, married Gypsey girls, who had
been brought up to service in families, twenty thousand useful
subjects might be calculated upon as gained to the State in the
first generation.</p>
<p>Should the efforts of individuals, require assistance from the
State, to render their plans effectual; surely they may depend on
the co-operation of a British legislature, to promote the <!--
page 255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>cause in which they would embark!&nbsp; On this point
may be adduced the judicious observation of Grellmann: &ldquo;If
the Gypsey knows not how to make use of the faculties with which
nature has intrusted him, let the State teach him, and keep him
in leading strings till the end is attained.&nbsp; Care being
taken to improve their understandings, and to amend their hearts,
they might become useful citizens; for observe them at whatever
employment you may, there always appear sparks of
genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every well-wisher to his country must be gratified in
observing, that as soon as the conflicting tumult of nations is
calmed, and the precipitations attendant on military supplies
have subsided, the attention of the Legislature is turned to the
investigation of some of the causes of human misery at home; and
to the means of increasing the social comforts of a considerable
portion of British population in the metropolis of the
kingdom.&nbsp; This recommencement of operations, directed to the
important object for which Governments have been
instituted,&mdash;the good of the people,&mdash;encourages <!--
page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>the hope, that the most neglected and destitute of all
persons in this country, whose cause we have been pleading, will
not be suffered to remain much longer unnoticed and
disregarded.</p>
<p>When at length the veil that has obscured them is once drawn
aside, can British benevolence withhold its exertions, to elevate
the moral tone of this degraded eastern race, and to call forth
the dignity of the human character, in exchange for the strange
torpor and vileness in which this people are involved.&nbsp; Here
an occasion presents for the display of a temper truly Christian,
and for the erection of a standard to surrounding kingdoms, in
which also these outcasts of society are dispersed, of that
philanthropy and sound policy which are worthy of a great
nation.</p>
<p>Such an experiment, though on a limited scale, may furnish
various data for judging what may be effected for their
countrymen, the countless myriads of British subjects, inhabiting
the vast regions of Hindostan.</p>
<p><!-- page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>Alexander Fraser Tytler, late Assistant Judge in the
twenty-four Pergunnahs, Bengal Establishment, in his highly
important work, entitled, &ldquo;Considerations on the present
Political State of India,&rdquo; after pointing out the depravity
which prevails to an extraordinary degree among the population of
India, states in the 313th page of the first volume, that
&ldquo;Poverty, or according to the definition of writers on
Police, <i>Indigence</i> may be said to be the nurse of almost
all crimes.&nbsp; To find out the causes of poverty, and to
attempt their removal, must therefore be the chief object of a
good police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been remarked, that this author drew his conclusions,
not only from what he understood of human nature in general, but
from what he daily saw before him, in the circumstances and
actions of the people whose crimes he was called upon to
punish.&nbsp; And he reasons upon the subject in the following
manner: &ldquo;Great poverty among the lower orders in every
country, has an immediate effect in multiplying the number of
petty thieves; and where the bounds of the moral principle have
<!-- page 258--><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>been once over-stepped, however trivial the first
offence, the step is easy from petty theft to the greater crimes
of burglary and robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Britons in their conduct towards the Gypsies, be actuated
by a policy so liberal, as to induce the rising generation among
this neglected class, to attach themselves to civil society, and
to enter into situations designed to inculcate habits of
industry, and prepare them to become useful members of the
community.</p>
<p>The successful experiments lately made by the British and
Foreign School Society, upon persons addicted to every species of
depravity, leave no doubt of the practicability of ameliorating
the condition of Gypsies.&nbsp; It is with pleasure that on this
subject the following statement of facts is introduced,
respecting two schools established in the neighbourhood of the
metropolis.&nbsp; One of them at Kingsland, a situation which has
been termed, &ldquo;A focus where the most abandoned characters
constantly assembled for every species of brutal and licentious
disorder.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other is at Bowyer-lane, near
Camberwell, a district inhabited by persons <!-- page 259--><a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>of the
worst description; among whom the police officers have been
accustomed to look for the various kinds of offenders, who have
infested the Borough of Southwark.</p>
<p>We are informed by the Committee of that School, that
&ldquo;in the district embraced by their Society, the
consequences of ignorance were evident to the most superficial
observer.&nbsp; Parents and children, appeared alike regardless
of morality and virtue; the former indulging in profligacy, and
the latter exhibiting its lamentable effects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the friends of <i>universal education</i> require a
fresh illustration, they would find it in the scene we are now
contemplating; and they would confidently invite those who still
entertain a doubt on the subject, to a more close and rigid
examination of that scene, satisfied with the effect upon every
candid and unprejudiced mind.&nbsp; For, assuredly, &ldquo;men do
not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles:&rdquo; and
when morality, decency, and order, are gradually occupying the
abodes of licentiousness, misery, and guilt, the change must <!--
page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>be attributed to some operating cause, and <i>that</i>
cause must be derived from the Source of all Good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principles of decorum, of propriety, and of virtue,
are instilled into the youthful mind; and by a powerful reaction,
they reach the heart of the parent; the moral atmosphere
extends&mdash;its benefits are felt and appreciated&mdash;the
Bible takes its proper place in the habitations of poverty; and
thus in its simple, natural, and certain course, the <i>germ</i>
of <i>instruction</i> yields the happy fruit of <i>moral
reformation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If as Grellmann computes, there are not fewer than 700,000 of
these people in Europe, who do not either plough, or sow, or the
greater part of them contribute in any manner to the improvement
of the country, or the support of the State, what a subject is
this, for the contemplation of Governments!</p>
<p>In reference to England, it is a beautiful exclamation of the
Christian Observer: &ldquo;Surely when our charity is flowing in
so wide a channel, conveying the blessings of the gospel to the
<!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>most distant quarters of the globe, we shall not
hesitate to water this one barren and neglected field, in our own
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Uniting cordially in this appeal, it is a
great satisfaction to be able to state, there are traits of
character in this people, which encourage attention to Gypsey
soil.&nbsp; Let it but be cleared of weeds, and sown with good
seed, and the judicious cultivator may calculate upon a crop to
compensate his toil.</p>
<p>Greater proof of confidence, as to money transactions, not
being misplaced in Gypsies need not be given, than in the
testimony of the landlord at Kirk Yetholm, to William Smith, that
his master knew he was as sure of their money, as if he had it in
his pocket.</p>
<p>In Dr. Clarke&rsquo;s Travels, published in the present year,
Part the 2nd of Section 3rd, page 592, are the following
observations respecting the Gypsies of Hungary: &ldquo;The
Wallachian Gypsies are not an idle race.&nbsp; They might rather
be described as a laborious people; and the greater part of them
honestly endeavour to earn a livelihood.&nbsp; It is this part of
them who work as gold-washers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>In page 637, the Doctor remarks: &ldquo;The Wallachians
of the Bannat, bear a very bad character, and perhaps many of the
offences attributed to Gypsies, may be due to this people, who
are the least civilized, and the most ferocious of all the
inhabitants of Hungary.&rdquo; <a name="citation262"></a><a
href="#footnote262" class="citation">[262]</a></p>
<p>Could grateful sensibility of favors received, and of personal
attachment, be more strikingly evinced than in the promptitude of
Will Faa, who when he was eighty years of age, on hearing of his
landlord being unwell, undertook, at the hazard of his life, a
journey of a hundred miles, to see him before he died?</p>
<p>The attention of Gypsies to the aged and infirm of their
fraternity, is not less exhibited in the case of Ann Day, whose
age is inserted in a work on human longevity, published at
Salisbury in 1799.&nbsp; She was aged 108, and had not slept in a
bed during seventy years.&nbsp; She was well known in the
counties of Bedford and Herts, and having been a long time blind,
she always rode upon an ass, attended by two or three of <!--
page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>the tribe.&nbsp; A friend of the author, a farmer near
Baldock, who had frequently given food and straw for the old
woman, says of the attendants she had, her comfort and support
seemed to be their chief concern.&nbsp; He considers her
longevity a proof of the kindness she received.&nbsp; Her
interment, which was at Arsley, near Henlow, was attended by her
son and daughter, the one 82, the other 85 years of age, each
having great grand-children.</p>
<p>It must have been a satisfaction to every one interested in
the improvement of human nature, to observe the number of
advocates who have come forward, within the last ten years, in
this country, to plead the cause of this despised and abused
people.</p>
<p>In bringing their case before the public, the author has aimed
at discharging what he thought incumbent upon him to undertake on
their behalf.&nbsp; He trusts that persons much more competent
than himself, will be induced to give effect to whatever measures
may be thought best adapted to promote the temporal, as well as
spiritual benefit of this people; and <!-- page 264--><a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>that as H,
the correspondent of the Christian Observer, remarks:
&ldquo;amidst the great light that prevails, the reproach may be
wiped away from our country, of so many of its children walking
in darkness, and in the shadow of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can a nation, whose diffusive philanthropy extends to the
civilization of a quarter of the globe, and to the evangelization
of the whole world, be regardless of any of the children of her
own bosom, or suffer the pious, truly patriotic solicitude of her
King, for the instruction of the meanest of his subjects to
remain unaccomplished.</p>
<p>Many persons appear zealous to send Missionaries to convert
heathens in the most distant parts of the world; when, as a late
writer <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a> observes, &ldquo;the greatest, perhaps
of all heathens, are at home, entirely neglected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace and tranquillity are favorable to the improvement of the
internal condition of a country; and can Britain more
unequivocally <!-- page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>testify her gratitude for the signal
favors conferred upon her, than in promoting that object for
which rational beings were formed&mdash;the glory of God, and the
happiness of his creatures.</p>
<p>In relation to the uncultivated race we have been surveying,
may a guarded and religious education prove to them, as the voice
crying in the wilderness: &ldquo;Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make straight in the desert an highway for our God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The subsequent declaration, without doubt, is descriptive of what
should be effected under the gospel dispensation: &ldquo;The
crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And
the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and <i>all flesh</i>
shall see it together; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it.&rdquo;&mdash;Isaiah, Chap. xl. v. 3, 4, 6.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
